<blockquote>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">A 
    star fell on my face when I was lying in bed this morning. It was a plastic, 
    glow-in-the-dark one, with its adhesive all worn out, a chunk of some stellar 
    arrangement Lucas made on our ceiling.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
    What startled me more than the quick jab on my cheekbone was my sudden inability 
    to raise my arm and touch my smarting skin. I tried to shake off what little 
    sleep I had but my head felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. Then I rubbed 
    my right arm against the sheet (all soft and smooth from years of washing) 
    but the sight of that very arm lying still on the faded blue gingham defied 
    all sensations of movement and texture. <a href="shift01.htm" target="_self">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></font></p>
