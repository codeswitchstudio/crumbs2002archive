        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFF99" size="4">

          <font color="#99FF66"><br>
          </font></font></font><font size="1" color="#99FF66" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          <font color="#CCCCFF">I never had your fondness for things that have 
          seen better days. I remember how you bit your trembling lip when workers 
          razed our old rambling house on De Jesus Street to build townhouses 
          of marble and Mactan stone. (Part of me was secretly glad they tore 
          it apart before it would collapse all by itself.)</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">I 
          can still remember how the floorboards creaked and the vermin scurried 
          as we went on secret quests for secret doors and enchanted antique chests, 
          charmed stuff that you were positive the house possessed. I had always 
          equated age with squalor but you somehow managed to make me forget as 
          you rambled on and on about new things to discover behind the wooden 
          panels of Tia Sepa's altar with its creepy red incandescent light.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">You, 
          with your wide-eyed fascination, turned iron grilles with their rusty 
          curlicues into a gateway to storybook worlds imagined. Like that time 
          when we pretended it was Namia behind the old cabinet where you joyfully 
          stumbled upon that box of old coins and those empty blue bottles that 
          you said held magic potions that we could use to cure your dad. Even 
          after the house was gone, you wanted to count the rings of those Balete 
          tree stumps with their gnarly roots.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">Whenever 
          it was time to part, you took the sun and laughter home with you and 
          I would lie in bed staring at gray drapes and droopy water-stained ceiling 
          panels while deaf Tia Sepa yelled that it was suppertime and that I 
          better go downstairs or starve in the dark.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">I 
          don't know exactly how many sunsets it took your mother to decide that 
          it was improper for bubbly young girls to hang around growing boy's 
          rooms. Eventually you moved away and I've since wondered how you fared 
          as I struggled with the complications of growing up.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">And 
          so we meet again, in of all places, a hospital. You, in your white intern's 
          garb, caring for elderly patients, me peddling boxes of diuretics and 
          other German pharmaceutical wonders so I can surround myself with shiny 
          new things that I hardly have time to enjoy. (If I keep going beyond 
          my quota, next month I can replace my old sedan with a 4-wheel drive. 
          )</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">Once 
          again you regaled me with stories that surrounded you. Stories no longer 
          imagined but all too real. Stories of patients whose names and faces, 
          were it not for your concern, I would otherwise not have cared to know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">So 
          I got to hear about Lolo Oben, the obsessive 76-year old schoolteacher 
          with the most perfect set of teeth. You told me he had seven different-colored 
          toothbrushes, one for each day of the week. I still chuckle as I imagine 
          him pulling one out from a special ventilated drawer, and gazing lovingly 
          at its bristles. You told me that Manang Mameng who dressed in rags 
          and reeked of piss was a collector of money, a wealthy miser, who owned 
          vast tracts of land. Then there was Nanay Auring who secretly hoarded 
          all the hospital food brought to her, a habit she acquired in the Second 
          World War. The list of the old folks and their strange collections goes 
          on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="1">In 
          a way, I'm the same as these people clinging on to tangibles, trying 
          to make sense of what is left in their lives. What I want to collect 
          are my few moments with you for you make me remember how it is to laugh 
          like the children we once were. I'm grateful that you give me the time 
          of day during your short coffee breaks in the hospital. I even cherish 
          those few minutes of your talking in my car when you once let me drive 
          you to a rambling old house, a different one from where we used to play, 
          an ancestral home beautifully restored by the lucky man you call your 
          husband. #</font> </p>
