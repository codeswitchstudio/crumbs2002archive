        can guess by the set of footsteps, whose feet exactly those are that I 
        hear, going up or down the stairs in our ratty old apartment. Kuya's pudgy 
        feet make this plick-plack sound as he trudges up and down the wooden 
        steps in his smelly brown leather slippers. Manang Cita goes barefoot 
        most of the time but her joints go creak-creaking and her heavy heels 
        go blag every time she walks. </font></p>

        like Cinderella, I lost a slipper. I lost my lovely right sandal with 
        its banana-yellow strap and big black buckle. So where'd it go? Well, 
        it seems to have turned into a lonely boat floating underneath these busy 
        city streets. </font></p>

        when I got down from the bus, there was this flattened tin can that I 
        planned to kick all the way till it reached our doorstep. Don't ask me 
        why, but when I saw this rectangular slit by the sidewalk, I aimed to 
        shoot the can with a neat and swift kick. With a whoosh and a scrape, 
        the can (and -aaaah!- my sandal) made their way into the gutter as easy 
        as coins going through a piggy-bank slit. </font></p>

        The sandals were new! We lined up a long time to pay for them one Sunday 
        at the mall.</font></p>

        I'll just hop about on one foot, when I get in the house, and she won't

        Cita looked the way I expected she would look and sounded the way I thought 
        she would: &quot;Ayyy naku!&quot; She declared sternly. I walked up the 
        stairs to my room with footsteps, heavier than hers. Much later, when 
        I went down to eat, she clucked and went, &quot;Tsk tsk, Next time don't 
        go kicking tin cans on the street. You might get sick of tetanus!!!!&quot;</font></p>

        The Visitor </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Kuya 
        had this lady visitor at the apartment one really gray rainy afternoon 
        after the rains. I was the one who opened the door since Kuya was still 
        brushing his teeth. <br>
        <br>
        Wow! (That was what I said in my head when she came into the room.) It 
        wasn't like she was amazingly weird and had three arms or anything like 
        that (and even if she had, it wouldn't really matter.) She was very beautiful, 
        but not in a TV star sort of way. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She 
        flowed into the room, like music. Little round brass bells tinkled from 
        her wrists, which had lots more bracelets and charms and things. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She 
        let me borrow the big beaded bracelet for a while. It was heavy. But her 
        movements were so light, and her trinkets were like chimes moving with 
        the wind.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">While 
        waiting for Kuya to come out and entertain her, she asked me how old I 
        was and looked at the framed pictures on top of the piano. Then, she brought 
        out these little drums, from this big basket that she brought and entertained 
        me. The drums were made of stretched lizard skin which I found a bit scary 
        and strange and fascinating. She taught me to make music on them with 
        my palms. It was hard at first to get a steady beat. She just told me 
        to close my eyes and follow the thump-thump of my heart. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Next 
        thing I knew she was dancing (I couldn't keep my eyes closed for long.) 
        She put on this weird sort of headdress. It was like a tiara made of beads 
        -red, orange, green, blue, and crystalline- (not those plastic ones, sold 
        on the overpass, mind you, but made of dark brown seeds, and yellow-green 
        glass ) and feathers with flowers made of shells. Then she did this graceful 
        flying motion that made her hands look like wings then she and whirled 
        like she was starting a spinning contest with the ceiling fan. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Kuya 
        soon emerged and took the drums away from me. (I didn't know he could 
        play those things.) What a sight we were in the sala. The lady took my 
        hand and we were whirling and twirling. Her flowing dress was like a flag, 
        unfurling.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Like 
        the TV says, &quot;time really flies fast when you're having a blast&quot;. 
        Before I knew it, Kuya soon had to bring her to the airport. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Later 
        on, I found that lady's headdress-thing lying on the sofa. Manang Cita 
        saw me and took it and put it away; way up in that shelf that holds all 
        the thick books and other things shouldn't be played with. When Manang 
        wasn't looking I took a stool, grabbed the headdress and ran to the roof 
        deck. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I 
        wore the beaded tiara and sashayed my way between the water tank and the 
        TV antenna. There beneath the dripping clothes lines, I danced and pretended 
        I was a beautiful queen, goddess of all the stray cats of Quezon City. 
        The crown was too big for my head so I held it in my hand and spun around 
        till I could see it make a nice blur of red, orange, green and blue. When 
        I stopped spinning, I played make-believe that all the blaring bus horns 
        on the street below were bellowing beasts, trying to blend in tune my 
        own special music that they couldn't drown out. As I sat there catching 
        my breath, everything in the city stopped being so gray.</font></p>
