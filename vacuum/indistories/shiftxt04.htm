<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Lucas finally 
gets home </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">and 
I'm only halfway done with cleaning up the angry mess I made in the rest of the 
apartment. Rumpled bedsheets and towels are still on the floor. The do-it-yourself 
bookcase has to be reassembled and books and magazines are flung on a messy heap 
on the bare mattress. The Japanese dividers lie collapsed so the apartment's partitions 
for sleeping and eating have now merged into one whole dump. </font> 
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;That 
  time of the month again?&quot; the sexist asks. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  ignore him completely, walk to the kitchen sink and start washing a pile of 
  crockery and greasy pans even though I know it's his turn to do them. </font></p>
<p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It's 
  Alex isn't it?&quot; he starts </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Well, 
  Du-uh?!! I won't even start asking about her. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Long 
  talks, that's all I ever have with her, Glen.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  think of my long talk and walk with Makie. - there definitely were sparks there. 
  But that's nothing compared to what fireworks I imagine are going on between 
  Alex and Luke. The thought of them just hitting it off with animated conversation 
  and all that shared laughter makes me just as jealous as the thought of catching 
  them getting physical. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My 
  hands briskly scrub the insides of a coffeepot until the soap suds come out 
  of the spout . I hate washing dishes, likewise this sound of steel wool on stoneware. 
  Lucas tries to take over and picks up a soft sponge to wipe the frying pan I'm 
  doing next. He moves me out of the way of the sink then tries to concentrate 
  on the task but I can see his hands all fidgety. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
  lump in my throat gets bigger and the silence becomes heavy till a small, wavering 
  voice forces its way out of me. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
  feel excluded Lucas. Why do you exclude me?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I'm 
  sorry if you felt out of place at school Glen. Is that why you were so weird 
  at the canteen?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
  was what? -&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Maybe 
  I haven't given you much attention lately. You know I can't be around you all 
  the time.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I, 
  want you to NOT be there all the time so I can have someone to run to. I know 
  you have your thing and I have mine. But we used to share something.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Your 
  job is getting to you-&quot; He starts again </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
  don't think it's just that, Lucas. What about those weekends you went off and 
  left me.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;You weren't interested in my parties and outings. You told me to go ahead.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;In 
  case you didn't notice, I was tired and feeling down. Why should I drag you 
  into my misery?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Ask 
  yourself that now, Glenda.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Silence. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;So 
  is this it, huh? The part in movies and books where the doomed pair realizes 
  they're drifting apart and shit like that?&quot; I say. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Heavier 
  silence. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I'm 
  sorry I'm not so into us anymore.&quot; Lucas says at last. </font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My 
  face begins to grow really hot and I look away as my insides get into meltdown 
  mode.</font></p>
