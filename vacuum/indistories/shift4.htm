  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">It's 
    been months since the break-up. After his brief appearance that fateful day, 
    Mark Macasaet asked me if Lucas was my brother. I said he used to be my live-in 
    boyfriend. Makie has been sort of avoiding me since then. I still catch him 
    averting his gaze from me every now and then. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">It's 
    funny how we both knew nothing about each other's personal lives. Tina says 
    Makie has this long time, long-distance girlfriend that he's feeling frustrated 
    about. The sexual tension between us is on hold. I'm swearing off relationships 
    for a while to fix the one I have with myself. The day-mares still bug me. 
    I now try to keep them at bay with newly learned meditation exercises and 
    consultations with that psychic Jesuit Nilo Veratta.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">I 
    have one more week to go till this graveyard shift is over and now I'm getting 
    ready to move out of the Quezon City flat and get a life. I peeled off Lucas's 
    glow-in-the-dark stars from the ceiling above what's now my own bed. I gave 
    most of them away to these office people and stuck three of the smallest ones 
    above the window frame near my desk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't 
    it Oscar Wilde who once said we're all living in the gutter but some of us 
    look up at the stars. </font></p>
