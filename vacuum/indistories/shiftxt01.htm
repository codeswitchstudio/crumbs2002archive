  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My 
    motionless state began to scare me and I could hear my heart thump loud and 
    fast. I knew I was awake for I could feel my hair tickling my shoulders with 
    every amplified swoosh of the ceiling fan. I could also make out the strains 
    of a lunchtime show on the Arnaldo's side of the apartment. I badly wanted 
    to scream but my voice was trapped and I couldn't even drop my jaw. There 
    was nothing to do but close my eyes and wait until everything turned to black.

    &quot;That was the emergency? Another bad dream?&quot; Lucas exclaimed on

      I tried to wake up and I couldn't move. This is the third time this week 
      that this happened.&quot; I said </font></p>
    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Honey, 
      you just think you woke up. I have those too. I wake up, get dressed, brush 
      my teeth and suddenly the alarm clock rings and it's all just a dream.&quot; 
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;That's different Lucas, you don't understand. This has been plaguing 
      our family for generations.&quot; <br>

    <br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Honey, 
    why don't you just go take the normal daytime shift if this is giving you 
    problems -&quot; </font></div>

    &quot;You're telling me to give up, is that it?&quot; </font></div>

    &quot;Listen Glen, I have to get back to the kids.&quot; </font></div>

    &quot;They're just drawing, can't you leave them by themselves?&quot; </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    &quot;No, I'm doing an interactive thing, you should see it. I'm playing reggae, 
    some Kundimans, and the funny honky-tonk stuff you like; they're painting 
    the wall based on the tunes. Tell you about it when I get home&quot; </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    &quot;I won't be home when you get here remember? </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    &quot;Well, I'll be home a bit earlier than usual. I have some inking to do&quot;</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    Oh great, he goes home early not for me, but for the comics. </font></div>

  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Things 
    haven't been too easy for me ever since I got into Graveyard Shift at Towerbank 
    and it's only been 3 weeks. The hours aren't so vile: 10 pm to 6 am instead 
    of 9-5 at thrice the pay. I did expect some difficulty in sleeping schedules 
    since I, for a fact, never doze during the day. The lights should always be 
    turned off every time I sleep. A sliver of sun from a doorway crack distracts 
    me and I can never dig a lifestyle requiring cute little night lights plugged 
    into wall sockets. I expected my biological clock to go bonkers these first 
    few days but what I didn't expect were the nightmares. <br>
    <br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Technically 
    I shouldn't call them nightmares because they don't happen when I sleep at 
    night. They only happen when I sleep during the day. (That is why I never 
    practiced siesta as a kid. I would always run off by myself when my playmates 
    had to take their afternoon naps.) Besides, I don't think I should classify 
    those paralyzing episodes as dreams. <br>
    <br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Makie, 
    a guy from work, seems to comprehend what I'm going through. He gets these 
    falling sensations in his sleep and he wakes up all freaked out, grasping 
    his pillow and kicking the sheets. According to him, it's a body-mind thing. 
    He suggests that what I'm going through might lead to astral projection or 
    some funky out-of-body experience that I really don't need in my life right 
    now. What I need right now is a shot of vodka, or melatonin or something.</font></div>

    It's 8:30 and Lucas isn't home yet. Here I am, sitting by his drawing board, 
    waiting for Godot and staring at his stuff. Taped on the frame of his overhead 
    lamp is a clipped classified ad that had us in hysterics two weeks ago. It 
    says Wanted: Stripper. (A local paper was in need of a new comic strip series 
    and he applied and showed them his work.) </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Crumpled 
    balls of paper, the chaff of his thoughts, accumulate on the floor where stacks 
    of sketchbooks and piles of assorted paper rise. Lucas's brightest ideas are 
    in these sheets of cartoons: his latest project, a series called The Friendly 
    Aswangs. <br>
    <br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">He 
    did his best work at night filling neat little cels with pen and ink for a 
    separate animation project. Sometimes he would be so absorbed, he would forget 
    I was there, waiting for him to join me in bed. <br>
    <br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Funny 
    how he always throws in his own physical features in the details of the characters. 
    I see the shape of his eyes on a duwende wearing inline skates, his stubborn 
    cowlick on a muscled tikbalang, and his thick brows on a tobacco-puffing kapre. 
    He used to draw caricatures of me as well&#133;.although I don't think there's 
    anything resembling me in this new stack. The only female character in this 
    series is this mermaid with corkscrew curls and enormous eyes behind thick-framed 
    glasses. Nothing like me at all. The phone rings and my train of thought is 
    derailed. </font></div>

      It's Lucas and he's still in the campus to oversee some stage design for 
      a school play with Alex Cruzadas, the theater teacher. I even miss hanging 
      out with his artsy-fartsy friends. <br>
      <br>
      Lucas might be home by nine depending on the Manila traffic. But I would 
      be in transit by then, heading off for another fun-filled night as a cyborg. 
      It's no help at all that our apartment is in Quezon City while I work in 
      Makati and Lucas teaches at a girls' school in Manila but I've been thriving 
      in this place since college before Lucas moved in. We just can't let go 
      of the reasonable rent, the scent from the ilang-ilang tree outside our 
      jalousies, and our often absentee land lady who never gets on our case for 
      shacking up without a marriage license. <a href="shift3a.htm" target="_parent">
