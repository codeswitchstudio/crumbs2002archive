<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I'm standing 
  in front of the bathroom mirror,</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
  turning the sink faucet on to soak a bit of toilet paper and wipe away the dried 
  toothpaste splatter on the smooth surface of the looking glass. My reflection 
  says I look like shit. Eyebags, insomniac's skin, crabby countenance. I feel 
  worse than the way I look. </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  tiled wall behind me is plastered with images and colors. Paper and the other 
  stuff we couldn't throw away: Promotional postcards with nice pictures , pages 
  from glossy magazines, Foto-me ID shots of us during our giddy dating days , 
  catchy quotes, bumper stickers, the reflections of Luke's huge comic book pin-up 
  collection all staring back at me. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Horror 
  vacui. Fear of empty spaces. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
  learned that term back in college at my art studies elective course where Lucas 
  and I first met. He was the mischievous big guy across the aisle making wonderful 
  caricatures of Professor Obinia and showing them to a bunch of us right after 
  class. Always aware of his presence, I never thought he'd acknowledge my existence 
  until Christmas break rolled around and he gave me this flat parcel wrapped 
  in red handmade paper and abaca twine . I opened it and saw a sketchpad full 
  of images of myself in different angles, rendered in pen and ink, the way Lucas 
  saw me that whole semester. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Horror 
  vacui. Fear of empty spaces. Lucas's aversion to blanks. Blank pages, blank 
  walls, heavy silences. Blankity-blank-blank blank. I feel like a TV screen going 
  kaput. The whole picture shrinks into a single white dot before it disappears 
  into total blackness. Lucas hates blanks and now I hate Lucas who likes being 
  in the thick of things and gets easily lured by the next catchy thing. Huge 
  crowds around showroom window TV screens attract him and he always slows down 
  like to be part of a throng gathered round a road mishap. There never was a 
  dull moment with Lucas talking and being in the flow, dishing out advice, fascinating 
  people with his sketchbook doodles. I hate that he no longer tries to impress 
  me. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Breakfasts 
  with Alex, art exhibit openings, who knows what else? I'm not even sure of what 
  I'm jealous of anymore, the attention he gives Alex , or his job happiness and 
  fulfillment that I don't seem to be a part of anymore. Lucas is so full of that 
  shit, he has no more room for me. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Alex 
  fills him with her spotlight and theatrics. I don't wanna know what he fills 
  her with. I need my space to wallow in. Wide open spaces to run to, no clutter 
  and no bad sleep. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There's 
  nothing like the sound of cardboard and paper ripping. Bits of bathroom tile 
  break off and stick to the stubborn tape that has gone yellow with time. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">My 
  destruction of the bathroom collage doesn't help me feel better. My apologies 
  to The Invisibles, The Maxx, and Doom Patrol. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
  read somewhere that solitude is really filled with other people. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">***</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Lucas 
  finally gets home and I'm only halfway done with cleaning up the angry mess 
  I made in the rest of the apartment. Rumpled bedsheets and towels are still 
  on the floor. The do-it-yourself bookcase has to be reassembled and books and 
  magazines are flung on a messy heap on the bare mattress. The Japanese dividers 
  lie collapsed so the apartment's partitions for sleeping and eating have now 
  merged into one whole dump. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;That 
  time of the month again?&quot; the sexist asks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
  ignore him completely, walk to the kitchen sink and start washing a pile of 
  crockery and greasy pans even though I know it's his turn to do them. </font></p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;It's 
  Alex isn't it?&quot; he starts </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Well, 
  Du-uh?!! I won't even start asking about her. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Long 
  talks, that's all I ever have with her, Glen.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
  think of my long talk and walk with Makie. - there definitely were sparks there. 
  But that's nothing compared to what fireworks I imagine are going on between 
  Alex and Luke. The thought of them just hitting it off with animated conversation 
  and all that shared laughter makes me just as jealous as the thought of catching 
  them getting physical. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">My 
  hands briskly scrub the insides of a coffeepot until the soap suds come out 
  of the spout . I hate washing dishes, likewise this sound of steel wool on stoneware. 
  Lucas tries to take over and picks up a soft sponge to wipe the frying pan I'm 
  doing next. He moves me out of the way of the sink then tries to concentrate 
  on the task but I can see his hands all fidgety. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  lump in my throat gets bigger and the silence becomes heavy till a small, wavering 
  voice forces its way out of me. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I 
  feel excluded Lucas. Why do you exclude me?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I'm 
  sorry if you felt out of place at school Glen. Is that why you were so weird 
  at the canteen?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I 
  was what? -&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Maybe 
  I haven't given you much attention lately. You know I can't be around you all 
  the time.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I, 
  want you to NOT be there all the time so I can have someone to run to. I know 
  you have your thing and I have mine. But we used to share something.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Your 
  job is getting to you-&quot; He starts again </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I 
  don't think it's just that, Lucas. What about those weekends you went off and 
  left me.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;You weren't interested in my parties and outings. You told me to go ahead.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;In 
  case you didn't notice, I was tired and feeling down. Why should I drag you 
  into my misery?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Ask 
  yourself that now, Glenda.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Silence. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;So 
  is this it, huh? The part in movies and books where the doomed pair realizes 
  they're drifting apart and shit like that?&quot; I say. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Heavier 
  silence. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I'm 
  sorry I'm not so into us anymore.&quot; Lucas says at last. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">My 
  face begins to grow really hot and I look away as my insides get into meltdown 
  mode.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Lucas and 
  I. We move in different spaces now. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  just lost the biggest depositor in my resentment memory bank and I'm only halfway 
  done dealing with it. I've been through stress, appetite loss, nausea, slight 
  alcoholism, the usual heavy heartbreak shit and the all those clich&eacute;s 
  that really make you feel that a part of you died. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  wouldn't remember anything else from that day we broke up except that in the 
  midst of our quasi-confrontation, the buzzer rang and Lucas beat me to the door. 
  Talk about perfect timing. Makie was just in the neighborhood having dinner 
  with a friend at some nearby sisig place and he was wondering if he could pick 
  me up on the way to work. Lucas turned around and took one long sad look at 
  me. I shook my head so he told Makie that I wasn't feeling well. The door closed 
  and I heard Makie start his car. Then I took a walk by myself to nowhere while 
  Lucas packed his bags. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><a href="shift4.htm" target="_parent"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></a></p>
