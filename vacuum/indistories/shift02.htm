<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I know this sounds sappy 
  but when I was small, I imagined that the chirping of crickets was the sound 
  of the stars. </font>We had this big duhat tree outside mama's window in Las 
  Pi&ntilde;as and that was where the insects resided, their cosmic hiss my constant 
  source of solace. I heard a faint version of the same sound when I moved in 
  here during college but I never get to hear them anymore since I started working. 
  Their sound has been replaced by this harsh hiss of reality, which sounds like 
  a punctured balloon's feeble gasp before it gets all shriveled up on the floor. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
  soon as I step out of our apartment to go do my job, everything becomes mechanical. 
  I take a sputtering tricycle to the main road, board a bus to Makati and walk 
  down a block of buildings. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 
  the rooftops I catch a glimpse of the sepia sky. Tonight's moon looks flat, 
  you could almost peel it off with your fingernails. Two curious, necktie-clad 
  passersby wonder what I'm staring at and tilt their heads. I walk past them 
  and enter the spanking steel and glass facade of the Tower. The guard nods his 
  head as I stride to the elevator to get to my floor where I punch in my identification 
  code, swipe a card, don headphones, face the computer and begin my shift. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
  job is in international customer service. I handle all the calls of clients 
  who use their credit cards abroad. I make dollar transfers for their fat bank 
  account funds on Eastern Standard Time. Truly thrilling. Welcome to my exciting 
  world. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually, 
  this is my second time to work for a bank. The first time was in a more conservative 
  bank that fired staffers who got pregnant out of wedlock, had a really prissy 
  dresscode, and hired background investigators that traced where you lived. Of 
  course they got on my case for living in with Lucas. Relatively speaking, the 
  graveyard shift is a much better environment. At least I don't have to deal 
  with rush hour traffic jams and the nine to five culture of buying stuff from 
  officemates who make you pay for unwanted fake designer shirts in a &quot;two 
  gives&quot; installment plan. At least I'm not part of that bunch of cup-noodle 
  slurping, stocking-clad office girls who flock to the ladies room with their 
  floral printed vanity kits for their daily ritual of tooth brushing and gossip. 
  (Now that was weird. One time, from the corner of the washroom, I saw this girl 
  literally foaming at the mouth talking about stapler ownership rights violations 
  and well, that culprit she was bashing turned out to be me.) The only reason 
  I'm working in a bank again is the money: the carrot on a stick that keeps me 
  in this race. What drives me is thought that when I've finally saved enough 
  cash, I'd be able to quit all this and put up my own biz, possibly in video 
  editing. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
  people doing graveyard are in it for short-term reasons as well. Dong, the guy 
  two cubicles away is saving up for his dream wedding. Tina is the insomniac 
  who strives hard to complete the education plan for her kid. Patty is the well-dressed, 
  bar hopping nine-to-fiver who's going back to her old shift as soon as she pays 
  her credit card dues. Marko Macasaet, or Makie for short, sits in the cubicle 
  next to mine. He's working to pay off his car loan and he has two more years 
  to go. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lanky, 
  boyish, and bespectacled Makie, has been extra nice to me. He brought me to 
  my doorstep two days ago in that car that he still slaves away for. He lives 
  in the South but he was going my direction that morning to pick up his mother's 
  X-Ray results at the Veterans Hospital. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
  was in his car that I got to tell him about my sleeping troubles (he brought 
  it up by asking me why I always looked like I needed sleep). The conversation 
  drifted to a whole bunch of other topics like Tina's horrible haircut, rants 
  about the drudgery of work, the new PJ Harvey CD , and when and where to watch 
  experimental films for free. I never mentioned Lucas to him that morning. It 
  was such a short drive. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">***</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  It's six AM now and faint daylight is peeking through the tinted window's vertical 
  blinds. Ergonomic chairs can only do so much for my lower back which aches like 
  hell after hours on my ass. My eyes feel like a peeled grape and I'm on the 
  verge of collapsing. </font></p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hey 
  you!&quot; Makie's head pops up from the divider. &quot;Wanna grab some grub 
  at the doughnut shop on Jupiter ?&quot; His has a nice wide smile with even 
  teeth.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sorry, 
  Makie but I really have to -&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No 
  buts here, lady.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
  not really in my element for small talk and I get this sudden compulsion to 
  brush my teeth. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Makie, 
  I'm not really up to it, okay?&quot; I hope he doesn't hear my stomach grumbling. 
  He pulls a long face and bargains. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;How 
  about some taho then?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
  have a friend who took up Food Technology and she says that that stuff has plaster 
  of Paris.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Aww, 
  come on. There's much worse in the other stuff we eat in the canteen. Okay, 
  if it kills you, funeral expenses are on me.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hmmm&#133;Okay, 
  done deal.&quot; How could I resist when he feigns disappointment so badly? 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
  step outside just before the city's hustle bustle unfolds. Makie forgets about 
  his precious car in the basement as we walk to Ayala Avenue. The air is cool 
  and cleared of yesterday's smog. The few sidewalk vendors are chatty and not 
  too stressed yet. We see the paperboy laying out his wares while the faint smell 
  of kerosene tells us that the bananacue vendor is there. Pretty soon we find 
  our regular taho vendor and make his day. Makie chugs taho faster than it takes 
  the man to dish it out. I watch as the vendor scoops equal amounts of the white 
  glop into our cups, tops it with tapioca and stirs in the syrup that coats my 
  throat with sweetness and warmth. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Taho 
  is truly an amazing food product.&quot; Makie says after three straight servings 
  of it. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ummmh 
  -huh?&quot; I say with raised brows. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
  mean, this is the only kind of meal that looks the same before and after the 
  process of digestion.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
  so we laugh the rest of the way until we reach the bus stop and it 's time for 
  me to head home. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  ***<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
  home, in our room, I am welcomed by the sight of Lucas sprawled on the sheets, 
  hogging the bed as usual. For a while, I watch him in deep slumber, his mouth 
  parted open and his knuckles curled against the sheet. Stroking his chin and 
  feeling his goatee stubble against my palm, I remember how I could never really 
  fall asleep beside him during our first few nights together. I would be fully 
  attuned to his breathing, aware of that open mouth and his loosening grip. How 
  I envy these men who fall asleep fast (ah yes, the same men who climax fast, 
  get hungry fast and eat even faster.) And yet, I miss the snoring that wakes 
  me up in the middle of the night. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  kick off my loafers, peel off my silk socks, blazer, blouse and slacks to don 
  an oversized shirt. Then I gently nudge my bed-hog to move over to his side 
  of the mattress. Lucas flutters his eyes open, rubs the sleep from them then 
  sits up. He kisses me then helps tuck me in while I slip underneath the covers 
  which are still warm from his body. My first few seconds in bed are also his 
  last. <br>
  <br>
  ***<br>
  I must have slept for 5 hours and now I'm in that now familiar stage between 
  sleep and the waking world. Consciousness sets in as the stupid phone rings. 
  But my body, once more, refuses to cooperate. Do not panic, I tell my frozen 
  self. So I breathe deeply for a few seconds and start to kick the air with my 
  right leg. At the fifth attempt it moves with a surprising suddenness. I stand 
  up and walk across the room to pick up the phone. The caller has hung up. It 
  might be Lucas, so I dial his school number but the line is busy. Then I pace 
  up and down and around the room . I can fight this. I can control this. I pick 
  up the phone and redial. Still busy. I feel trapped and confused. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not 
  having anything better to do, I get dressed for work and go out to kill time 
  in a shopping mall. I have more than enough time to see three whole movies but 
  what would happen if I fell asleep and got stuck there forever? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
  I decide to take a cab to Manila and surprise Lucas with a deli submarine sandwich 
  from the mall. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  ***</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  When I get to the school and look for Lucas, the guard asks me who I am and 
  I tell him I'm Mr. Lucas Santiago's, fiancee (even though I 'm not, but it sounds 
  more official than just 'girlfriend'). The guard's monobrow almost disappears 
  into his blue cap. Why is he giving me this weird look? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
  in, I check the classrooms and the faculty lounge but Lucas isn't there. Hoping 
  that he hasn't eaten yet, I head off in the direction of the canteen. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  see the familiar back of Lucas's head as he sits near some stone tables laughing 
  his head off with someone. I walk a few steps closer to get a full view of this 
  person that amuses him so much. It is a woman who I could mistake for one of 
  the older students if she was in a blue and white uniform like these droves 
  of prepubescent girls around me . </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  woman looks familiar. Now where have I seen that long curly hair and the thick 
  rimmed glasses that frame her big, round eyes?<br>
  <br>
  Suddenly, a throng of boisterous kids nearly mows me down . A tall girl comes 
  from behind me and yells a shrill . &quot;Hiyeeeee Miss Cruuuuzadas!!&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Miss 
  Ringlets waves with much gusto from her stone bench and I bite my lip. Alex 
  Cruzadas. The theater teacher. The Mermaid inspiration. Oh, what I'd give to 
  run a pitchfork through that fabulous hair. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  take in some air and do some yelling myself. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sir 
  Santieeeeeeagoh!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lucas 
  turns around. Why am I not surprised by that surprised look on his face? </font></p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Glenda!&quot; 
  he exclaims as he stands up. &quot;What? - Why?-&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  dangle the deli paperbag, and toss it in his direction. He catches it neatly, 
  plunks it on the table and walks towards me. Then he clasps my hand and drags 
  me to introduce me to the little mermaid with the big hair. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This 
  is-&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Alex, 
  the theater teacher. Yes, I 've heard so much about you.&quot; I say with a 
  fake smile. She smiles back and stretches out her hand. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Alex, 
  this is Glenda.&quot; Lucas says and pulls me closer. Frankly, I don't think 
  I can remember feeling more distant to him than I do right now as he wraps his 
  arm around my waist. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">***</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This has to be the worst meal in my entire life. What's wrong with this picture? 
  Me, me, me. At the school lunch counter, Miss Mermaid giggles at Lucas and his 
  stupid jokes. Jokes I've heard since grade school, has she not heard these punch 
  lines before? Way too much laughter from her makes me uncomfortable. Am I imagining 
  it, or has some sort of chemistry been unfolding behind my back? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
  they talk about art exhibits, tabla drums, fellow teachers, favorite students, 
  and more people and things I don't know about. What have I got to talk about 
  from my life? Work and how crappy it is? I just realized I don't have a life 
  outside Lucas, and work and occasional trips to the mall. So many thoughts running 
  through my mind and I can't blurt them out. How convenient for Lucas, she's 
  just right here.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Remember that skinhead guy in black at Starbucks, Tuesday morning?&quot; 
  Alex asks him. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starfuck! 
  Luke never brought me to Starbucks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Starbucks! 
  Where the trendy hang out and make believe they like real coffee? I hear that 
  place smacks of pretension.&quot; Of course I just have to say that. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Well, 
  it isn't so bad...&quot; she replies, waving a drinking straw between her fingers 
  like it was a cigarette. &quot;Piped in Fitzgerald, nice interiors, It's actually 
  pretty cozy.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cozy 
  breakfasts at Starbucks. Right before class! </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm 
  sure it's pretty. Pretty cozy.&quot; I mutter. A cozy for place for poseurs. 
  Lucas seems preoccupied with shaking the ice in his yellow paper cup. Maybe 
  he realizes that he never once took me out to breakfast anywhere. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Well, 
  anyways,&quot; Alex goes on, and looks at Lucas as well. &quot;That guy was 
  the son of National artist Bernardino Pepua.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
  what, name dropper? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Really?&quot; 
  Lucas says with genuine interest. &quot;He was my favorite artist as a kid. 
  We went on a field trip to one of the few galleries in Manila and I fell in 
  love with his &quot;Sunog&quot; series.&quot; How come I never knew that part 
  of his life? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Who's 
  your favorite artist, Glenda?&quot; Alex asks generously. Alabaster skin, red 
  lips, big eyes with matching sweeping lashes. If I shaved off her crowning glory 
  she'd still look good. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh 
  Glen likes Gustav Klimt's - &quot; Lucas starts. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
  hate Gustav Klimt!&quot; Awkward silence. A shrill siren pierces it. Lucas and 
  Alex are saved by the bell. I head for home and think about calling in sick 
  at work.<a href="shift03.htm" target="_parent"> &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></font></p>
