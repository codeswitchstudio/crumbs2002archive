  <p><font color="#00CCCC"><b><br>
    <font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Great Aunt Eva's</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    altar was an institution and sometimes even a tourist spot in Bukal, the province 
    where I spent several summers growing up. </font></b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God, 
    those summers. I remember, how every night we had to pray the whole rosary. 
    Not just a decade of it, mind you. We'd recite the entire bloody thing with 
    appropriate litanies to all the names of Virgin Mary and Aunt Eva's top ten 
    saints.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like 
    repeated chants of prayers and the wrenchingly bizarre wails of old folks 
    singing the pasyon; all that Folk Catholicism just makes my skin crawl sometimes.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recall 
    how Mang Pepe, the deaf spiritista, who normally spoke in sign language, would 
    have the voice of either a real 3- year old boy or a really good anime voice 
    talent whenever he got into a trance. (HIMALA!!!!!) Aunt Eva claims that he 
    was possessed by the Sto Nino then. And during those trances, the supposed 
    Christ Child would address each of us by name, telling us to be good children 
    as we knelt in the room, our knees all red from the floor wax.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aunt 
    Eva's altar which was in her bedroom, was this wooden cabinet that was covered 
    by a table cloth which had yellow pompoms at the hem. The cloth was red, a 
    red carpet for around 30 or so statues, standing in formation with their pure 
    smiles, like pins in the bowling alley of bloody martyrdom.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Except 
    for the replica of the Black Nazarene, the statues were mostly these Aryans 
    with elaborate Spanish conquistador robes, skins of porcelain or alabaster, 
    deep-set <a href="shiny.htm">watery eyes of the shiniest glass</a>, and long 
    sweeping lashes with permanent mascara</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    largest one, a centerpiece in his own glass booth, was St. Joseph the Worker. 
    Dressed in green and brown robes, with a wire wig of curls, and the kindest 
    face, he was my favorite guy statue.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
    favorite girl statue was this carved bust of the young Virgin Mary. It was 
    small and white and simple, set like a cameo with folded hands and a face 
    which had this almost Lolita-like playfulness. It was easy to imagine her 
    sticking her tongue out when no one was looking.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also 
    had much fascination for this blue-tinted &quot;Jesus and the Agony in the 
    Garden&quot; picture frame with those holographic 3d-effect things you could 
    stare at from different angles.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
    some strange reason there was a pair of Buddhas in there, too. At the back 
    of the Black Nazarene sat the jolly big fat colored piggy bank Buddha with 
    his Boddhisatvas. Behind the Lady-of-the-Rosary-Holy-water-bottle-with-the-screw-top-crown 
    was the brass version of Siddharta in Lotus position.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    rest of the icons gave me the creeps. The smell of flickering candles and 
    the eerie glow of a red incandescent light bulb were no help either. All that 
    made me think twice about helping myself to the bowls of hard candies, coins, 
    and anting-antings that lay on the altar which, incidentally, was right across 
    Aunt Eva and Uncle Edong's queen-sized bed. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
    that bed I could feel these sets of eyes watching my every move as my young 
    mind wandered.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
    for my Great Aunt Eva and Uncle Edong, I guess they never did naughty things 
    in bed anymore.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
    again...</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#00CCCC" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-Circe</font></b></p>
