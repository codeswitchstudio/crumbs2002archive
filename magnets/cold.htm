  <p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFCC">cold 
    lemon grass tea</font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    that's what i remember. cold lemon grass tea. served in one of those glazed 
    and deliberately deformed brown terra-cotta mugs.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">somebody 
    somewhere (i forget) already wrote about what the color green would taste 
    like. well, for me, this was the thing. this lemon-grass tea. if its taste 
    were music, it would have the high notes of a flute, not piercing but crisp 
    and clear and flowing. lemon grass tea with a twist of lime on a hot sticky 
    summer noon makes me think of forest -glade and shades and rustling leaves 
    speckled with the sun; things and days of a more innocent time: fresh and 
    not quite ripe (its flavor neither bursting or luscious yet so exquisitely 
    distinct). <a href="tongue.htm">a play of sensations on my tongue</a>.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">afternoon 
    tea with the ballerda sisters was always an event during those years. those 
    two were big on tea-time and throwing these get-togethers. i might not remember 
    our exact conversations on art and life and the bits of gossip about this 
    or that person anymore. but what i would always remember would be that cold 
    lemon grass tea. </font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">i 
    always meant to brew some myself.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">but 
    it wouldn't be the same.</font></font></p>
