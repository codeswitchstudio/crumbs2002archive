    <font color="#FFFFCC"><font size="7" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC">&quot;Krishna</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC">. 
    </font></font></font></b><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">I'm 
    changing my name to Krishna&#133;..&quot; She speaks with her head up, as 
    if addressing the gray clouds hovering above us.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So you're into Vedic literature now?&quot; I start, and as usual, she 
    pays me no heed. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sri Krishna, the all-attractive, original being!&quot; She continues 
    in this voice, which is even more theatrical than her usual. I wouldn't be 
    surprised if the thunder rumbled on cue.&quot;I don't see what's wrong with 
    'Gin', Gin.&quot; I note, trying to keep up with her as we make our way through 
    this minefield of murky puddles and sensitive issues that go beyond the small 
    talk of newly-discovered alliances.<br>
    <br>
    I check my shoes to make sure the water doesn't seep in. Yesterday's fresh 
    asphalt (I still remember its smell and her boot-print on that steaming hot 
    patch of bulldozed black) now reminds me of old coffee dregs floating in today's 
    fresh potholes. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;My father gave me my name.&quot; She says, wrinkling her nose. &quot;He 
    comes up with Castor and Pollux for the twin troglodytes. To me, he gives 
    his own ma's name. Virginia. Now, how creative is that?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Without warning, she jumps right into one of the rain-riddled craters. &quot;<a href="lola.htm">Lola's 
    name.</a> He's into recycling, alright . Recycling and Segregation. Mister 
    environmentalist politician yada-yada.&quot; She scoffs. <br>
    <br>
    There is not much love there, as she talks in her trademark animated way. 
    Her father held a fork against her head when she crawled into the house at 
    4 this morning. It hadn't bled, her scalp, but I can imagine the mark the 
    prong made on the skin beneath <a href="webs.htm">her soft shorn hair</a>.
