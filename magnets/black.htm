  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">when i 
    was small,<font size="4"> i had a fondness for buttons.</font></font><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
    not those things that fasten your clothes, but those shiny, colored, and (usually) 
    round things that you fasten with safety pins at the back.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">you could 
    say i was fasten-ated. hahah (sorry, i couldn't resist)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">anyway, 
    i collected a bunch of those. there was the peace sign button (how Sixties) 
    a yellow smiley one (how Seventies) and one with concentric circles in rainbow 
    colors from a young aunt of mine. There were buttons with product logos like 
    the BMW &quot;pizza&quot; and buttons with catchphrases (&quot;when in doubt, 
    shut up&quot;) and political slogans (&quot;marcos, resign; ninoy di ka nag-iisa&quot;). 
    i even got a bunch of little traffic signs (&quot;stop!&quot; &quot;yield&quot;)<br>
    that came free inside bags of jack and jill cheesecurls. my favorite pin, 
    however, was a museum souvenir with the mona lisa wearing curlers in her hair.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">when i 
    was small, i also wondered why some people fastened these small black plastic 
    rectangles on their shirts. intrigued by the object, i even asked a classmate 
    of mine to trade hers with one of my cheesecurls freebies. <a href="freak.htm">she 
    looked at me like i was some kind of freak.</a> no wonder, i thought after 
    she explained to me that those black things meant that someone in her family 
    just died.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">a modern 
    sack cloth and ashes. i don't see those anymore.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">when my 
    own lolo died, we didn't fasten any black rectangles. incidentally that lolo 
    of mine left this collection of silvery Russian pins engraved with Lenin's 
    head, stars, and intriguing cyrillic inscriptions. cleaning out my<br>
    closet, i found them last week stuck on an old acid-washed denim jacket. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">only one 
    was in good shape. the rest had turned to rust.</font></p>
