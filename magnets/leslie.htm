  <p><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The actor 
    Leslie Nielsen</font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF"> 
    slipped into a coma a couple of days ago. That was one of the last things 
    I read in the papers. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">You have 
    anything to declare? The guy in uniform said. I shook my head. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">I realized 
    before, that the world becomes smaller as you grow old. The process is vastly 
    exaggerated in the <a href="afterlife.htm">afterlife.</a> Well in mine, anyway. 
    I was still reeling, seeing all these familiar faces in the line ahead of 
    me. I figured, it doesn't matter if our lives never intersected, the fact 
    is, a few people who I saw in my lifetime (who, I guess, had croaked at approximately 
    the same time frame) were in the same queue. An amusing irony. Famous stars 
    in your old real life have bit parts in your afterlife.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">It appears 
    though, that not everyone here could see me. Only one familiar face actually 
    acknowledged my presence a while ago. On my way to deposit my Emotional Baggage, 
    I spotted the neighborhood street kid, the glue-sniffing waif. I tried to 
    follow her but the crowd was too thick. I saw her head for the Lost and Found 
    Section (to regain her lost childhood, most likely).</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Standing 
    in line, waiting for forever isn't all that boring. Leslie Nielsen, the silver-haired 
    comedian was three people ahead of me. He was arguing with the officer about 
    his Expected Time of Departure. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Suddenly 
    a guy at the very end of the long, long line excitedly called out his name. 
    It was Manoling Morato.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Leslie 
    ran to him like they were lovers separated by extraordinary yet unavoidable 
    circumstances. Maybe they were. -Circe</font></p>
