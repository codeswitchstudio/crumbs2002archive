    </font></b><font size="6">A</font>t the inn, there was no hot water available. 
    We had to lug the icy water in a bucket from the tap in the laundry area right 
    outside Dinky's room. To get to the tap, you had to go through a maze of clothes 
    lines where Dinky's huge and damp underwear hung, flapping like sails in the 
    biting wind.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">Dinky 
    was the only one who insisted on taking a bath every single morning and night 
    after a hike. Even if it felt like zero degrees outside. Even if the bathroom 
    stalls, with their doors made of rickety wood and galvanized iron sheets, 
    had busted locks that wouldn't latch well. When the inn ran out of those little 
    shampoo sachets, Dinky climbed uphill to get some at the Shamrock Yogurt House.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">Dinky 
    was my alarm clock during our stay at the inn. Every morning, I'd wake up 
    to his Sado-masochistic screams as he poured the <a href="cold2.htm">cold 
    water</a> down his head. (Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrgh!!!!! Shit. It's mother-fucking 
    ccccc-cold! Splash! Aaaaaaaaaargh!) It was great to begin our day early so 
    we could make the most out of the few days left of our stay in the Northern 
    mountains.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">It was 
    okay when we were the only ones staying on that wing. After a few days though, 
    a couple of Belgian backpackers bunked in the room beside mine, right across 
    the shower stalls. (Lovely couple, those two.) </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">One particularly 
    freezing morning, I woke up to Dinky abruptly stopping in mid-scream. Finding 
    it strange, I opened the door and took a peek out the hallway.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">I could 
    see the back of the Belgian girl, standing outside the shower stall. She held 
    the door open and said something mighty unpleasant to Dinky who was standing 
    in the stall naked. Obviously, she had no need for screaming wake-up calls.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">Later, 
    all throughout breakfast (mmmm, Shakshuka) at the Yogurt house, Dinky's face 
    was red as a strawberry. A blush perhaps or maybe from the cold. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCCC">I'll tell 
    you about the Belgian hikers some other day. -Circe </font></p>
