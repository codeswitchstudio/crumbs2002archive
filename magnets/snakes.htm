  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">Snake 
    liquor.</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
    That has got to be the strangest thing I ever drank. Lorca's uncle said he 
    got it from Vietnam and he dared us to try it after dinner at their place.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It shouldn't 
    be too different from those worms in tequila, I thought. Besides, I was feeling 
    particularly adventurous that day so I had no second thoughts until Lorca 
    lugged the huge carafe from the dirty kitchen </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Snake 
    liquor, indeed it was. There were four bloated snakes coiled neatly and snugly, 
    head to tail, forming a floating wall that eroded inside that bottle. Sheesh. 
    I could still see their sharp teeth in the wine (which was kind of hazy in 
    some parts so that it was hard to figure where each snake ended and the clear, 
    yellowish alcohol began.) </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Memories 
    of bottled specimen samples in bio lab. Formalin-pickled fetuses and what-not 
    in  jars right up there on dusty high shelves with the stuffed cats with 
    their empty eyes and their rotting teeth.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Ugh. Lorca 
    slammed two shot glasses on the wooden table and poured the stuff on.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Here's 
    a toast to Adam and Eve and gardens of earthly delights!</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I closed 
    my eyes, winced, and lifted the shot glass to my lips. <a href="gin.htm">The 
    stuff tasted like gin</a>, only a bit stronger, with an aftertaste so slimy 
    and organic, it made me want to throw up.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Later, 
    Lorca's uncle said the snake liquor was some sort of aphrodisiac: recommended 
    for older men with young wives. I guess it was an acquired taste. <br>-Circe</font></p>
