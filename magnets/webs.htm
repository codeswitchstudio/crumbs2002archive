  <p><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">For some 
    reason, </font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">she 
    wore this bandana over her head, her hair cut short like a boy's. It suited 
    her, the haircut, and everytime I'd see her wearing that bandana, covering 
    her hair, I'd always ask myself &quot;Why?&quot;. She also wore these dark 
    shades (that she got for about 20 pesos from a vendor below the MRT), its 
    frame violet. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">Her skin 
    has a healthy yellow tinge to it, pale yellow, like a lemon seen through a 
    white silk-screen frame. And her lips are pink, like cotton candy and Bazooka 
    Joe's. And one thing about her (and I just thought of this), is that she never 
    wears make-up. No lipstick, no mascara, no foundations blahblahblah.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">A breath 
    of fresh air, actually.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">She was 
    lying down in front of me, her back to the carpet, her head propped up by 
    a pillow. I was lying on my belly, my upper torso propped up by my elbows. 
    Arranged like yin and yang, like the Piscean twin fish, like sixty-nine.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">Our noses 
    were touching each other, nostrils to nostrils. &quot;This must be how the 
    Eskimos French-kiss,&quot; I told her, rubbing my nose against hers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">What she 
    exhaled, I inhaled.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">&quot;Hehehe. 
    It smells like beer!&quot; she said with a bit of a laugh. And yeah, it did 
    smell of beer. It was warm and musky and gamey. A mix of beer and femininity. 
    It was pretty intoxicating. More intoxicating than the beer, even.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">That close 
    to her, I could see tiny blood vessels on her cheeks. "... like pink delicate 
    spider webs..." I remember reading once, from one of her stories.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">My eyes 
    were directly over her lips, and at the back of my head, I was thinking &quot;I 
    wonder how her lips would feel like, against mine? Soft, even pillowy, perhaps?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">Almost 
    by reflex (an urge, a jolt in my brain), I moved up to kiss her. A light peck 
    on the lips.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">I pulled 
    away (the contact was only for a second or two, no more) and looked at her. 
    Her skin now had this yellowish-pinkish tinge to it (pink lemonade!!) from 
    the beer, her lips still Bazooka Joe's-pink (soft and sweet and pink as cotton 
    candy!!). No lipstick, no mascara, no foundations blahblahblah.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">She was 
    the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. And she was smiling.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">We breezed 
    through the night in a bit of a daze.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">The morning 
    after, clearing the table, fluffing the pillows a bit, I found her bandana 
    on one of the couches in the living room, and her dark shades on one chair 
    (where she put her down her blue bag).</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">I smiled 
    when I saw them, for some strange reason. Reminded me of her, I guess.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6699">I made 
    a <a href="mentalnote.htm">mental note </a>to give these back to her, next 
    week, maybe? Maybe. </font></p>
