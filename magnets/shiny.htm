    many habits from friends. It's usually them picking up from me: a few choice 
    words here an there, a certain accent, a certain mock-laugh... But, every 
    once in a while, there are some people whose habits I pick up. Some good, 
    some not, I guess.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Everytime 
    Saffron and I would ride the MRT, we'd walk down to the edge of the platform, 
    to the front end to wait for the train. It's automatic for her, I guess. And 
    I'd be the puppy, following her wherever she went. We'd stand beside the platform's 
    rear-view mirror (permanently affixed to a pole near the edge of the station, 
    right at the mouth), waiting for the train to come.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Everytime 
    we would ride the thing, we'd be there at the front car.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">10 o'clock 
    in the morning, in the Quezon Ave. station. I came from school, fixed up several 
    things for several people. I was travelling alone, went there via the backyard, 
    so to speak, and decided to leave the place through the front door.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I walked 
    to the station, and out of habit (which I picked up from the countless times 
    Saffron and I rode the MRT), I walked to the front end of the platform and 
    waited for the train.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">While 
    waiting, I decided to waste my time looking at myself at the rear-view mirror 
    (narcissistic, I know). And I saw the strangest thing.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I saw 
    a boy's face, of indefinite age.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Sad, watery 
    eyes, must be from sleep deprivation. Hair's dishevelled like anything, like 
    a tornado ran against him. Skin's covered by a thin film of oil, giving him 
    this bronze unnatural shine. Lips a bit pink from the <a href="cold.htm">cold</a>. A medium-sized goatee, pathetically distributed 
    at about an inch or two of chin-space. A thin moustache covering the top of 
    his upper-lip.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It was 
    mine. But for some strange reason, it was vaguely familiar, like it wasn't 
    me, like it was someone else. Like I was looking at someone completely separate, 
    completely detached from me. Like my twin. Like it was someone who looked 
    like me. Or maybe it was an older me, my face from five years in the future? 
    Or maybe a face from childhood, a neighbour from the old village, perhaps? 
    Or a long-lost relative from Scotland?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I raised 
    my hand to waist-level. I wanted to shake my reflection's hand. And then the 
    klaxons sounded. I turned away from the mirror, and I saw the train pulling 
    over at my side of the station.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I looked 
    back at the mirror before I stepped into the car, but the mirror was in an 
    angle, and all I saw were the people at the cars behind ours, trying to get 
    into the train.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The whole 
    trip, I was scibbling away on a piece of paper, writing a love letter for 
    Saffron. But somewhere in my head, I was thinking &quot;I had a close-encounter 
    with myself, there.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#9999CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It was 
    weird.</font></p>
