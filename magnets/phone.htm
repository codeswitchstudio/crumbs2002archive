<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">I met 
    Lily back in high school, </font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">on 
    our Senior year. She was thin and dark, and just about my height. She came 
    from Singapore, her family moved back to the Philippines to take care of her 
    dying grandmother's home and assets and whatnot.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">I fell 
    madly in love with her on a September morning. It was a Saturday, on our field 
    trip to one of those provinces four to five hours from Manila proper. The 
    sun was up and it was pretty much cooking us with our own sweat. I was hanging 
    about with this kid (who'd later turn out to be her younger brother) named 
    Abraham. A pretty great kid, smart for his age and all that. Liked him, first 
    time I met him. He was that sort of guy.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">I saw 
    Lily walking towards me (actually, towards Abraham), the pavement beneath 
    her feet glowing, like it was light itself. It made these strange reflections 
    on her face, light form below. It was a nice effect. Time stopped for me, 
    that moment.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">The months 
    after that went by like water down the sinkhole, fast and liquid. We talked 
    on the phone like anything, discussing love and religion and philosophy and 
    books and whatnot. The things that I used to do to impress girls.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">One night, 
    we were talking about pendulums, when she shifted the topic to this guy named 
    Christopher. He was a schoolmate (we were even in the same level)and a neighbor, 
    and I knew him pretty well, being friends since we were Freshmen. I went along 
    with the ride, with me sharing some dull anecdotes about the guy.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">And then, 
    all of a sudden, she said &quot;I have a crush on him.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99"><a href="quiet.htm">I 
    was absolutely quiet for about half a minute.</a></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">Haven't 
    talked to her since, and that conversation is about six years old, now. I 
    got a letter from her recently. She's in Canada right now.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">She didn't 
    even phone me when before she left. Wouldn't really have helped, but well, 
    you know.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">I still 
    think about her, every once in a while.</font></p>
  <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC99">-Juli
