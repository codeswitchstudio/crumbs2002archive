  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFCCCC">I 
    was absolutely quiet for about half a minute, staring at my palms.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFCCCC"><a href="webs.htm">The 
    lines were light as fresh spider webs</a>. The creases seemed like they were 
    made by a pen that kept on writing even though it had already ran out of ink.</font></font></p>

    he just say they almost looked like paws? )</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFCCCC">An 
    old soul, (Read my boldtype oh Palm-readers!) his lines were deeply etched. 
    More earthy, I suppose. Earthy and sensual versus light and ethereal? In my 
    head lay a vast galaxy of more contrasts.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFCCCC">&quot;God, 
    they're beautiful, your hands.&quot; A strange thing to hear and yet<br>
    that was the nicest thing anyone noticed about me all week.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFCCCC">There's 
    nothing like holding a hand that feels right. Harmony for about half a minute. 
    If life was a hard rock, perhaps moments like that were its shimmer.</font></font></p>
