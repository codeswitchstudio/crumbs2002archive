    Whenever </font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00CCFF">one 
    of us felt blue, (him usually in between checking endless stacks of his students 
    papers, me usually in between jobs or relationships.) we would find some time 
    to meet and rant about our lives over brewed coffee and an oatmeal cookie.<br>
    <br>
    Lance was fond of The Azure, this cozy cafe near the Makati Med which had 
    this whole lighthouse theme to it; genuine anchors and portholes, life savers 
    threaded by thick ropes, salt and paper shakers in the form of lighthouses, 
    the works. And we'd sit there by the coffeeshop window watching the rush hour 
    yuppies on the street. Then <a href="talk.htm">we'd just talk for hours</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00CCFF">Lance 
    would usually start by sharing his exuberance for whatever book it was in 
    which he chose to bury his nose in: Anne Carson's mindfucking essays on Eros, 
    William Carlos Williams' biography, Mark Strand's compelling poetry. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00CCFF">While 
    I'd rave about Murakami, Chungking Express, or comic books, he'd initiate 
    a very scholarly discussion on love, ethics, and metaphysics (which I'd usually 
    interrupt with a wisecrack or a bit of lame gossip I'd hear about people in 
    circles we shared.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00CCFF">A good 
    coffee break and a great exchange of stuff that feeds our heads. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00CCFF">Then it 
    would be dark outside and we'd look for a cigarette vendor by one of the lamp 
    posts . After a stick of nicotine, we'd part ways: him back to checking his 
    papers, me back to my everyday world, a sense of wonder regained.</font></p>
