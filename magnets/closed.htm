    Saffron listened to the 4AM rain do a tap dance on the roof. &quot;Sid takes 
    the most beautiful pictures with his words. He has his own way of seeing things....&quot; 
    she thought, while removing a book from her bed in the dark. <br>
    <br>
    The dark. The dark. Half awake, she remembers the dark. <br>
    <br>
    And the dark twin pools of <a href="eyes.htm">Sid's sad eyes</a>. She remembers 
    looking for herself in them and letting herself go adrift.....<br>
    <br>
    &quot;God, it's Tuesday!&quot; (Used to be the days were a blur of interchangeable 
    blahs.) <br>
    <br>
    And so Saffron drifted off to a slumber, a bit overwhelmed yet comforted by 
    the thought that each day was becoming more unlike the one before. </font></font></b></font></p>
