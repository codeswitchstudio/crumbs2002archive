    was</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"> eleven years old, I happened upon 
    my birth certificate. It was the original, with the embossed seal of St. Luke's 
    Hospital on it, <a href="blister.htm">a blister on the paper</a>. I was looking 
    for my uncle's old Lego pieces, digging through the old cockroach-eaten cardboard 
    boxes full of books and old toys and folders chock-full of paper.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    found the birth certificate between the pages of my old books from kindergarten 
    (crayola-moustaches drawn over the photographs). My name was there (of course), 
    along with other personal information that were up-to-date, a few minutes 
    after I was born.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
    eyes drifted down towards FETAL DEATHS. It said 01 in typewritten numerals. 
    I asked my mother about it.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You 
    see,&quot; she started slowly. &quot;there was a kid before you. We didn't 
    have enough money, then, so we had to have it... aborted.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It 
    was depressing (i can imagine). I know you have no idea how it's like, but...</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Your 
    father and I vowed that the next time a baby comes, we'd be prepared. Your 
    dad worked his ass off, in concerts, in side-projects, in his boardwork... 
    the money piled up like anything.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And 
    then, when we had you, we had enough money. And we were happy.&quot; and with 
    that she went back to painting the ceiling.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
    right there, breathing the stale smell of wet paint, I believed her, then.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, 
    when I think about it, knowing what I know, I think my mom was lying.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every 
    once in a while, I think about the baby that came before me, who it could've 
    been. I sometimes pretend that I was that baby. I'd think how I thought the 
    baby would think, if I was it.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    the thing is, I'm male. I always did think that the lost baby was a girl.</font></font></p>
