    paper.&quot; I noted, scraping off the bit of wax on the page with my fingernail. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Candle-drip.&quot; She smiled sheepishly. &quot;Half an hour into the 
    brownout, we ran out of batteries and I just had to see what happened to Alyosha.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Pata always returned my best books in a sorry state: battered, dog-eared, 
    with the spine cracked and the cover frayed, as if vermin had feasted on the 
    sides. This never stopped me from letting her raid my shelves on a regular 
    basis. I was always unable to resist telling her about the newest title I 
    got from the bargain bins. Often I found myself shopping for books with her 
    in mind. <br>
    <br>
    Savoring the shared pleasure of a story's twists and turns, the two of us 
    would talk about book heroes as if we knew them personally, the way people 
    in class would gossip about <a href="2time.htm">who two-timed who last weekend.</a><br>
    <br>
    A fast and furious yet thorough reader, Pata certainly sucked the marrow out 
    of the printed words that moved her. Often she'd get me excited about rereading 
    the books that I lent her, rediscovering passages that were lost on me the 
    first time (digging up details that only struck me when she raved about them.) 
    Sometimes whole paragraphs would be highlighted or page margins would have 
    cryptic notes scribbled in pencil. I didn't mind, really. It's not the paper, 
    but what's on it. I rationalized.<br>
    <br>
    I remember how in school, Mrs. Luz would meticulously wrap the library tomes 
    in the thickest plastic to protect them from the elements and grubby hands. 
    That wasn't enough to make the books Patricia-proof. In our library, during 
    that time, the most beat-up books were the best reads. Even the beautiful 
    leather-bound edition of Invisible Cities (the one with the gold-gilt pages) 
    was not spared Pat's wear and tear.<br>
    <br>
    Always, she would return books with this penitent look on her face and the 
    librarians were never hard on her. How could they deny Pat her books? She 
    was a voracious reader, a brilliant writer, the outspoken star-scholar in 
    my literary club.<br>
    <br>
    Many years later, I found a thin volume of my very first published work, sitting 
    on a shelf in her flat which was cluttered with stacks of well-worn books.<br>
    <br>
    It was daunting to see my book in perfect condition. Good as new. </font></p>
