  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="6">It was 
    a dark </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">and 
    stormy night.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">&quot;Where's 
    your mother?&quot; my father asked me. I just shrugged my shoulders in response. 
    I didn't know where my mother was. &quot;She left to buy some ensemadas from 
    the bakery.&quot; I told him. That was about five minutes ago, and the bakery 
    was along Leveriza, two streets from our place (we lived in this apartment, 
    at the M. Santos extension).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">The rain 
    came pouring down three minutes earlier, and it was strong, coming down in 
    buckets. The sort that you had to speak up to be heard above the rattle and 
    jingle of our place's tin-plated roof, stamped on by rain. There was a storm 
    coming, and if i remember correctly, its name was Daisy (our storms were given 
    women's names). I was sitting with my legs crossed in front of me, playing 
    with Snake-Eyes and StormShadow. StormShadow has Snake-Eyes trapped inside 
    a Lady's Choice clear-glass jar full of water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">&quot;What's 
    taking her so long, then?&quot; my father asked me again. Standing by the 
    door, looking out to the rain, each flash of thunder and lightning coating 
    his features with a cold blue sheet. &quot;She must be waiting for the rain 
    to stop.&quot; I answered, my eyes leaving the two ninjas only for a second.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">A beat, 
    before he said &quot;Go fetch your mother.&quot; An order from on high.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">Hesitating 
    a bit, I stood from my spot, unfolding my legs like interlocking bridges. 
    We had an umbrella somewhere in the house, but in mild anger from my father's 
    request (what can you do, right? I was nine years old, then), I ran out of 
    the house without one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">A brown 
    river of rat piss and sewer muck was rushing along the street in front of 
    me. The water came up to people's inner thighs, but they were adults, and 
    were taller than I was back then. My clothes were now clinging to me like 
    second skin, wet and transparent. Without much thought, I jumped into the 
    flood.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">The water 
    came up to my navel. Under the lampposts' light, I saw people under bright 
    umbrellas, and people outside them. I nodded and smiled at the ones without 
    umbrellas, brothers and sisters for the night.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">Amidst 
    the drowning sound of rain, I could hear my teeth chattering. My spine and 
    abdomen were rippling from the cold. I wrapped my arms around me, for warmth. 
    The rain was cold. The night was cold. I felt warmth around my eyes, though, 
    right before the tears rolled down my face, before they got lost in the raindrops, 
    mixing and mingling with them. I closed my eyes and shivered in the rain. 
    My testicles shrivelled into me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">&quot;Sid, 
    is that you?&quot; I heard my <a href="mother.htm">mother</a> tell me. I opened 
    my eyes and there she was, umbrella in hand, a brown bag of ensemadas in the 
    other (steaming in the night, even), both wrapped around her, keeping the 
    cold at bay. &quot;M-mo-mom... Dad's l-l-look-ing ffffor... yyyyouu...&quot; 
    I told her between sobs and shivers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">&quot;Oh, 
    poor darling...&quot; she told me, unwrapping her arms to embrace me. It was 
    warmer, there, in her embrace. And dryer, under the umbrella.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC" size="4">I stopped 
    shivering.</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
