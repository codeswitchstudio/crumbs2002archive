    Belly to belly (both yellow), they danced with their heads up, wrapped around

    winding around the other, wrapped around one another's body, like twin corkscrews 
    being wound together. An open-mouthed kiss, an exchange of passion and mutual 
    love between the two of us. The exchange was gentle. Sexy.</font></p>
