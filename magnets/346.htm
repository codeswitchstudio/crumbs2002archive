  <p><font color="#CC99CC" size="7" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>
    <font size="6" color="#FF9999">When <font size="4">I was in high school</font></font></font><font color="#FF9999" size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,</font><font color="#FF9999" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    I had this girl classmate named Leslie. She was beautiful, I tell you. As 
    tall as I was (back when all the girls only came up to my nose), her hair 
    was, in a weird way, cut short, an apple-shaped cut, the color naturally auburn. 
    The cut was weird because when her head's in the normal position, her hair 
    only went down to her jawline. But when she stooped her head a bit, it would 
    flow down smoothly, and it created this weird illusion of being longer than 
    it really was.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">She had 
    a pretty deep voice, too. One day, she called me up at home, and my brother 
    answered the call. After our conversation, my brother went up to me and asked 
    if Leslie was a boy. Her voice was that deep. She also had this boyfriend 
    named Romeo. He was older by two years, and was taller than me (funny enough, 
    I only came up to his nose). He was Vietnamese.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">About 
    a week or so before school year's end, Leslie came up to me in the daily school 
    assembly. It was 6:30 in the morning, then. She held my hand and placed it 
    on her chest. A bit shocked, I looked at her, and there she was in front of 
    me, nose to nose, and she smiled. We walked to our classroom, our hands clasped 
    together.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">We talked 
    like anything, that day. Like we were lovers in the past, separated by extraordinary 
    yet unavoidable circumstances, like a World War, or maybe even a Family Feud 
    (for a moment, I guess I was her Romeo), and that we only had the whole day 
    to catch up on things missed, before I go away again for the French trenches, 
    or before her nanny discovers us in her bedroom. Everything under the sun, 
    from suicidal tendencies to ex-lovers to our classmate Paul Ian. I whispered 
    to her my darkest secrets, and she whispered to my ear hers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">And all 
    day, I held her hand, and she, in turn, held mine.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">3:46 in 
    the afternoon, fourteen minutes before the bell rang, I walked her down to 
    the school gate, to see her off to her school bus. And about ten paces in 
    front of us, waiting for Leslie, was Romeo. Letting go of my hand, <a href="leslie.htm">Leslie 
    ran to him like they were lovers separated by extraordinary yet unavoidable 
    circumstances. Maybe they were.</a></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">I looked 
    at my hand, the one that I used to hold Leslie's. It was hot and red. A blushing 
    <a href="quiet.htm">palm</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">I went 
    home pretty drained. My sleep was dreamless. It was a Thursday. That was around 
    eight years ago.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">I bumped 
    into her last year, in Quezon Avenue. &quot;Boss, chicks?&quot; the man in 
    red asked me. &quot;We have lots here, boss.&quot; he said, gesturing loudly 
    to a group of girls behind him. And then I saw her. A pale and pretty face 
    among a group of brown. She was still pretty. You could see that she aged 
    a bit, and her hair was now black, India-ink black (she actually looks better 
    with black hair), and it was still short, that weird apple-shaped haircut 
    that she had when we were classmates. She was still pretty.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">She didn't 
    recognize me. She didn't even see me. I just gave her a brief glance, stayed 
    on her a bit, trying to catch her eyes with mine. Unsuccessful. She was distracted 
    by a flock of nocturnal pigeons, pecking away at the concrete floor of the 
    parking lot.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9999">That day 
    I spent with Leslie, back in high school... it was a pretty sweet Thursday, 
    I guess. I don't get too many sweet Thursdays. -Juli</font></p>
