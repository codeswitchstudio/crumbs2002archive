  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">I</font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
    like old shoes.</font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <br>
    </font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">All 
    my pairs are second-hand (or maybe second-foot?), either passed down on to 
    me from an older relative, or borrowed from a friend, and never returned. 
    Old pairs have a certain charm to them, a certain feel. That comfortable fit, 
    like your lover's hand in yours. It feels at home, like an old friend from 
    high school, your drinking buddy for six years (before he left the country 
    for greener pastures in the Colonies).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I'd wear 
    these shoes until they break down on me. Some of them'd fall apart after a 
    few weeks, most after a few months (there was this one time when this black 
    pair of adidas trainers fell apart when i was walking to my place. i walked 
    two kilometers in my socks)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I got 
    my third pair of Chuck Taylor's from Joel. It was <a href="blue.htm">blue</a> 
    (or at least, it used to be blue -when i used it, it had this yellowish tinge 
    to it,) and it had that wear-and-tear look from at least five years of constant 
    use. I found it in his cabinet during one of our Mortal Kombat night marathons, 
    and I fell in love with it instantly. I actually stole it from him, got it 
    without him knowing.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">When he 
    saw me wearing them in school, he just shrugged and said &quot;It's all yours, 
    if you buy me lunch.&quot;. I bought him a plate of porkchop and rice from 
    the school canteen, and he gave me his Chuck Taylor's.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It fell 
    apart in the span of two years of steady rugged use. It went through hell 
    and high water, literally: wading though knee-high floods and rivers, stepping 
    on hot coals from last night's fire, climbed mountains with them, kicked several 
    pieces of gravel and rock with them. I even wrote poems in the white rubber, 
    drawing band logos and such.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The airholes 
    in the sides were the first ones that gave on me, the metal rings falling 
    from their places. And then the airholes came undone, turned into two slits 
    that ran from the pads of my feet to the first joint of my big toes. The soles 
    followed, coming apart strip by strip. The canvas started fading, too.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">People 
    kept telling me to buy a new pair. And not just friends, mind. Even strangers 
    came up to me, saying &quot;Buy a new pair, iho. Don't your parents have money 
    to buy you a new pair of shoes?&quot; I'd give them dirty snobbish looks at 
    that, wrinkling my nose.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Still, 
    I used them. I walked around school in them, without socks, even, so the pink 
    flesh of my feet peeked from the holes and tears. Seen everywhere with them, 
    they became extensions of me. When you say &quot;Siddharta&quot;, images of 
    black uncombed hair, sad eyes, a black guitar, and a rugged pair of Chuck 
    Taylor's come to mind. Like Elvis' sideburns, I guess. Those Chuck Taylor's 
    were the sideburns to my Elvis. I even have Kodak prints of me wearing those 
    bastards.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Well-worn 
    out, well-used, I finally turned them in for a pair of black and white Reeboks 
    from Marc. He used it for about a year or two. I used it for three years, 
    before the soles gave out on me in a Saturday. -Juli</font></p>
