      <font color="#CCCC66"><br>
    <font size="6">&quot;Mobile</font>&#133;.yeah, like the mobiles puh-people, 
    they cut me off, as if they've all conspired against me. Now I can't even 
    talk to Annette&#133;.not that she'd let me&#133;&#133;. Bi-itch.&quot; Kermit 
    trailed off, majorly smashed.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Huh? 
      You're speaking in tongues, man.&quot; I nudged him and glanced at my watch 
      with a sigh. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66"><a href="346.htm">3:46 
      </a>AM. Couple of hours left to get out of Antipolo, get some shut-eye, 
      then haul my ass to back to that miserable excuse for a workplace. Oh heck, 
      there are worse things than the aftermath of a post-breakup drink-up, I 
      thought. Besides, I was used to Kermit and his periodic whine sessions about 
      Annette. Wasn't it just last week that he was ranting about how suffocated 
      she made him feel?</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Relationships 
      are like these goddamn mobile services &#133;.&quot; (Kermit suddenly seems 
      coherent again.) &quot;I mean there's that commitment thing with the bill 
      rolling in every month. Then there are these little unspoken obligations 
      that accumulate, yeah&#133; and when you ignore them&#133;.you just get 
      cut off, without any fucking final warning.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Well, 
      that doesn't apply to everyone, Kerms. I use these Prepaid cards&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Pre-paid????!!!! 
      Yeah, why can't we just have pre-paid love, huh? Huh? You make your choice, 
      sans ball and chains, knowing fully well that it's gonna end at some point 
      after you've used it , and then you move on to the next and life goes on.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Pre-paid 
      love? Jesus Christ, Kermit. Even Woody Allen would think that's lame.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Why 
      not? I mean, there's pre-paid sex&#133;heheh.&quot; </font></p>
    <p> <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">&quot;Gimme 
      your keys, ass. I'll drive us both home.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">Alcohol 
      or not, I was amused by the lamest, most unromantic metaphors I had ever 
      heard during those unholy hours after Annette had dumped my friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">A month 
      after that, they kissed and made-up, and now they're together again. Kermit 
      still whines a lot</font><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCC66">
