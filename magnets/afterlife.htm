  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">I dreamt 
    of her the other night. </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She 
    was wearing this black lacy knitted dress (that hugged her body quite nicely). 
    Between the gaps in the <a href="black.htm">black</a> dress, I got glimpses 
    of her pale flesh. I was wearing a pair of green trousers, and a black shirt. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We went 
    inside this room where the walls were decorated with pink curtains, the wallpaper 
    had this floral pattern, it, too, in pink. She was with these girls, one of 
    them from old my high school, and the other one was Camryn Manheim.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">In my 
    head in the dream, I knew that there was a funeral going on. A girl's funeral, 
    but for some strange reason, it felt like it was someone's debutante ball. 
    It had that feeling throughout: the rooms, the colors, the dresses, the smells...</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I took 
    her hand and I kissed it, a light peck. I looked up at her and we both smiled.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">And then, 
    we started to dance. It was a slow sort of dance, with my head cradled on 
    her shoulder (as she was taller than I was), and with her head cradled over 
    mine (she had to stoop a bit). Hands clasped together, we swayed slowly to 
    the music (which I forgot, for some reason). I could smell the faint scent 
    of oranges as we danced. Cool oranges in a temperate summer day. That sort 
    of smell. We danced for quite a while.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We kissed, 
    and that's when I woke up.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;If 
    you ever die before me, ask if you could bring a friend,&quot; I remember 
    thinking. I made a mental note, to tell her that next time we meet.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;It 
    was a sweet dream,&quot; I thought, before drifting back to an uneventful 
    sleep.</font></p>
