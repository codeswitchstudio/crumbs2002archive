    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="7" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      I have this neighbor</font><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      named Marc who lives in a small two-storey house on the street right beside 
      ours. His brother is a local poet, award-winner and all that. Pretty much 
      a house- hold name of sorts, if you gravitate on those circles.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His 
      brother is about eight years older than Marc is. He's in Kentucky, nowadays, 
      teaching English to Caucasians.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marc 
      had this girlfriend named Diana. The girl was pretty enough, in a wallflower 
      sort of way. She wore her hair as a short bob, went down to her shoulders. 
      I used to see her often enough, when I passed by Marc's place. We'd just 
      nod and smile at each other. We didn't talk too much, and when we did, it 
      was mostly about some girl from her school named Monica, who, in Diana's 
      words, had 'the biggest crush' on me. She had a sweet voice, I remember.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marc 
      and Diana had been a couple since we were Juniors, which was about five 
      years ago. They loved each other about as much as lovers can love one another. 
      I even accompanied Marc around a week before their first year anniversary 
      to buy a pair of gold rings for the two of them.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three 
      months ago, Diana found out (through Marc's mobile) that Marc had another 
      girl. Her name's Odie (yeah, like the dog), and, according to Marc, she 
      likes wathcing soft-core porn flicks in sticky-floored theaters.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      realization was followed by an outburst from Diana. She stormed Marc's place 
      like a tornado: smashed up and burned their photographs, threw the rusty-blue 
      Russ bear in the bin, gave Marc's arms and face a bit of a beating, and 
      then, finally, gave him the finger.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A month 
      after that, they kissed and made-up, and now they're together again. When 
      Marc and I go out to drink, we pass by Diana's place, Marc checking up on 
      her (and her checking up on him, most probably).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
      as we drive down to the pub, Marc's <a href="mobile.htm">mobile</a> rings. 
      Of course, I'd be the one answering it, as he'd be behind the wheel, driving 
      us from Diana's house to the nearest beerhouse.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
      of the time, it's a text message. Sometimes, it's a phonecall.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
      it's always from Odie. Well, at least, everytime I answer it.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#6699CC" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-Juli</font></p>
