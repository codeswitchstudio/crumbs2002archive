    </font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="7" color="#FFFFCC"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">My 
    Lola's name</font></b> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">was 
    Gloria. She was a small woman, the old school sort. You know the type: housewife 
    to an abusive army husband, spawned eight children (boys and girls), expert 
    on baking leche flan... the old school sort.</font></font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
    have this neighborhood store about ten paces from our place. An old lady tends 
    the thing. And I'm telling you, she's old. Probably seventy-five, maybe even 
    eighty-six years old. Her hair is cut short, a boy's hair-cut (my hair is 
    actually longer than hers), white and wiry, like bijon noodles. Her pale skin 
    is riddled with earth-colored liver spots (I imagine when she was younger, 
    they were pimples), and her wrist's circumference is as thick as my three 
    middle fingers combined.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
    Lola is of the new school sort. The aggressive feminist grandmother, she hefts 
    bottles of beer to and from their closet-freezer. She calculates a customer's 
    purchase on her head (pretty fast at it, too). She even hauled out three bottles 
    of those one-and-a-half liters sodas that I bought from her yesterday, all 
    in one go.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
    when she laughs, a sweet cackling laugh, music to your ears, her crow-feet 
    lined eyes smiling with her.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
    Lola died when she was <a href="sixty7.htm">sixty-seven</a>. Doctors said 
    it was heart failure (in the autopsy, they found out that her heart had sunk 
    so low into her torso, they saw it about an inch or so above her stomach). 
    I call it heart-break. Her last few months were spent on her bed in her room 
    watching Spanish soap operas, a frown on her face half of the day, coughing 
    like anything the other half of it.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    Lola spends her days tending her store, watching Tagalog-dubbed 
    soap operas on her telly beside the shelf where the cigarettes are. She looks 
    like she'll be ninety in two years, and I still hear her sweet cackle, when 
    it's quiet enough in the neighborhood.<br>-Juli</font></font></p>
