    I count those little perfect circles, all randomly embossed. Twenty-nine on 
    the right one, thirty-eight on the left. His brown arms were otherwise smooth, 
    and hairless like a baby's.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#FF6633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 
    they went off to the pharmacy to get syringe needles for the tattoos, I heard 
    Elise talking about the skin as a canvas, as a record of memories for life 
    passages and pain.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#FF6633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel 
    like a sheltered schoolgirl with a silly milk moustache when I'm with him 
    and Elise. They've shared this life-on-the-edge sort of thing. A rehab, trances, 
    <a href="terminated.htm">a terminated pregnancy</a>, running away to strange 
    lands.....</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#FF6633" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now he 
    tells me he never once flinched when he put out those cigarettes on his own 
    skin. The drugs were that strong, he says. His gaze, so unwavering, grows 
    soft with each swig of San Miguel. I look away and awkwardly poke the crackling 
    fire with a dew-damp twig. I never thought, there and then, that I, of all 
    people, would be causing this so-called world-weary survivor, the least bit 
    of pain. -Circe</font></p>
