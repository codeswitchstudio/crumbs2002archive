  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">I </font><font color="#99CCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6"><font color="#6699CC">had 
    this bisexual Brazilian friend</font></font><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
    back in high school. His name was Bruno, and he had the biggest muscles in 
    the whole campus. He was pretty strong, like a gorilla. One time, we were 
    at another friend's house, this Vietnamese guy named John. They lived in a 
    condominium in Greenhills (right beside the mall and the school), and on the 
    top floor, near the swimming pool, was this private gym. Like most gyms, they 
    had one of those things where you pull some weights using a bar hanging on 
    a length of steel cable running along pulleys.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">For fun, 
    I tried to pull the bar down to my chest, about five weights on it. No go. 
    I was dangling like a monkey, the bar only budged an inch or two. John and 
    another friend of mine, Angelo, helped me out, pulling the bar down with me. 
    Still no go. The bar only budged three inches.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Then along 
    came Bruno. He sat down on the seat and pulled the bar down to his chest. 
    And he made it stay there for half a minute. He was pretty strong.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">He was 
    pretty good with the guitar, too. He taught me how to play samba (an Astrud 
    Gilberto song comes to mind. Forgot the title, though), and some daft chord 
    progressions and scales. Learned a lot from that guy.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Bruno 
    and I used to hang out by the staircase near our classrooms (he wasn't a classmate, 
    but we were on the same level), near the girls' toilet. <a href="talk.htm">We 
    sat on the steps and just talked about things</a> that interested the both 
    of us: guitar-playing, music, this girl named Michelle...</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">One day, 
    we were talking about Yngwee Malmsteen, when this girl named Ethel (a classmate 
    of his) butted in, saying &quot;Is it really that great, playing the guitar?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">My train 
    of thought a bit derailed, I said the first thing that came to my mind:</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;Only 
    when I pee.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Ethel 
    looked at me like I was some kind of freak.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">When I 
    graduated from high school, they gave me this scholarship on Computer Programming, 
    sponsored by Ethel's father, who owns this big computer supply place that 
    supplied the computers in our school. I never did take that scholarship. Wasn't 
    that interested in computers. Not that much.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">As for 
    Bruno, last I heard from him, he's taking Computer Engineering in some business 
    school a few streets from our place.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#6699CC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Haven't 
    talked to him in a while, now. But I still play that Astrud song, every once 
    in a while. Oiling the gears a bit, I guess.</font></p>
