    <font size="7"> I </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">have this memory from 
    childhood, of a red unblinking eye in the dark. The radio's eye, actually. 
    Those things that tell us that the radio's turned on and playing (as if the 
    music coming out of the speakers isn't enough indication). Every night, my 
    parents would turn down the lights and burn some sandalwood incense and smoke 
    some dope as they listened to Cohen, his voice reverberating across the room, 
    singing: 'Suzanne takes you down... to her place near the river... you can 
    hear the boats go by... you can spend the night beside her... and you know 
    she's half-crazy... but that's why you wanted to be there... '<br>
    <br>
    As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I would see faint outlines of the Hare 
    <a href="krishna.htm">Krishna</a> posters on the walls of their room, orange 
    and yellow prints against red-varnished wooden panels. The air inside the 
    room would be thick with the smell of dope and sandalwood, which always did 
    make me feel calm. My mom and dad would sing with Cohen, almost whispering, 
    like they were saying a prayer. Maybe they were.<br>
    <br>
    In the cozy folds of the pillows and blankets, I would pretend to be asleep, 
    just so I could hear them sing, an accidental lullabye for me. - Juli</font></font></p>
