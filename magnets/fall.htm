  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">I</font><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> 
    met her on a Friday.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;There's 
    a voice in my left ear,&quot; she told me. &quot;I'm in a dark room, it's 
    nearly four o'clock in the morning, I have my <a href="closed.htm">eyes closed</a>, 
    and there's a voice inside my left ear.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;I 
    love you,&quot; I whispered to the phone. &quot;No, you don't.&quot; she whispered 
    back. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; I whispered again.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">I don't 
    know why we were whispering, really. We were both inside a dark room, in bed, 
    phone speakers to our ears, receivers inches from our mouths, eyes closed... 
    physically, we were miles apart. Not too far away, but still, miles apart.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;I 
    have every reason to love you,&quot; I whispered again, but now a bit louder 
    (but it was still a whisper). &quot;and none to not love you. You're a brilliant 
    girl, Saffron. You make me laugh, you make me cry... &quot; I let it linger 
    a bit, waiting for her reaction. I could hear her motorized fan humming in 
    the background, and her quick breaths.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;And 
    you're a pretty girl, too. Everytime I see you, I fight the urge to kiss you. 
    Gentle-soft curves, I want to run my hands over your cheeks, your eyes, your 
    nose... tracing the shape and contour of your face... and you know Cohen.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She laughed 
    at that, her throaty laugh.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;I 
    may sound like I'm ripping Murakami off, but you're the 100% Perfect Girl 
    for me. My Dream Girl. Everything I've ever dreamed of, hoped for, wished 
    for... you're a Dream, Saffron.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;And 
    I'm glad I met you.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">A pregnant 
    pause. Pauses in our conversations were getting more and more frequent as 
    the days went by, for some reason or the other.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;I 
    don't quite know how to react to that, Sid.&quot; she told me, her voice serious.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;You 
    don't have to react, Saffron.&quot; I replied.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Another 
    pause. From her end of the line, I could hear the rain starting. &quot;It's 
    raining.&quot; she said, wonder in her voice. I listen to it.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;Yes. 
    Yes it is.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">-Juli</font></p>
