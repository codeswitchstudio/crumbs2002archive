  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<b>I'm 
    starting</b> <font size="4">a career as a professional sperm donor.&quot; 
    </font></font><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
    said way back then.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh 
    yeah?&quot; I asked. &quot;How? With a plastic cup or the natural way?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ruling 
    out possible risks of STD's and fatal attractions, au naturel, of course. 
    &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Of 
    course.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
    product won't be just the sperm. There's gonna be a Romance component....with 
    a variety of customized packages like walks by the beach, deep conversations 
    and what-not. &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Interesting 
    concept.&quot; I remarked.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It 
    should be a high-paying job, no?.&quot; He was getting more enthusiastic.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
    don't see why not. After all, it's a procreation and escort service rolled 
    into one.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If 
    you were childless, lonely and rich, how much would you pay for my services?&quot; 
    He asked me.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Uh..probably 
    a month's salary, max. Assuming I'd have a stable and a top-level job, that 
    is.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What 
    should I call it then?&quot; he asked. &quot;Give me something to put on my 
    business card. &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Umm, 
    Baby Maker? Stud muffin? Ah, no..&quot; I said. &quot;Flowers and Seeds.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hey! 
    That's a good one. God, it really is. &quot; he really sounded sold on the 
    idea.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Flowers 
    and Seeds. Sperm Banking and Romance.&quot; I added. &quot;What happens if 
    your clients <a href="fall.htm">fall in love</a> with you or if you fall in 
    love with them?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Well, 
    they'd have to sign a waiver or some disclaimer. But if I like them, my services 
    are free. . .. Anyway, if you ever need a donor, just gimme a call.&quot; 
    He said with a nudge and a wink.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Okay. 
    Mental note.&quot; I said.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Years 
    later, he became rich and had a cult following of pretty young things who 
    worshipped strange men.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So since 
    he is now too cool, too inaccessible, and too busy to fill up this petri dish 
    of egg cells, I am left with no choice but to look for the next best man to 
    sire my child.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'll name 
    the kid after him anyway. <br>-Circe</font></p>
