    I was a wee kindergarten brat, I had two mistaken notions. First, I thought 
    that all fire trucks in the Philippines were fire engine-red like in the books. 
    Second, I thought all mothers painted .</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">At least 
    that's what mama tells me.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She says 
    she found out about this the very first time I went over to Caroline-Ruth's 
    house to play with her pick-up sticks and these yellow Fisher Price blocks 
    of assorted shapes that you'd have to correclty insert into the proper slots 
    of a red and blue ball. ( For some reason, I vividly remember that part.) 
    Anyway, when I got home, according to her (and this has escaped my memory 
    entirely) I commented: &quot;Caroline-Ruth's mom is a bad mom, she doesn't 
    know how to make paintings.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Well, 
    the tables had somewhat turned when my conservative great grandma inspected 
    our house and passed judgment on mama who always let my sister Eggie and I 
    &quot;vandalize&quot; the walls of our bedroom. (That activity was incidentally 
    triggered by my sister who drew some stick-figure on the yellow-washed concrete 
    wall.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">That crayola 
    graffti was followed by kiddie cave paintings; splatters and smears, trees 
    and clouds and crescent moons in poster color reds, blues, yellows and greens. 
    Eventually the two of us, filled the walls up. Whenever we had a fight we 
    drew ugly faces of each other. My sister has the artist's hand. But I was 
    the first one who learned how to write and spell &quot;Eggie panget!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">When Lola 
    Ling saw this, she said my mom was a bad mom. She didn't know how to discipline 
    us yada yada yada. My mom, (those daubs of oil paint on her arms and clothes,) 
    just smiled and went back to cleaning her palette knife.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Year later, 
    I pick up that same palette knife and an old tube of hardened oil paint, from 
    the dusty floor. In ma's studio, I move around some old furniture (to make 
    room for my work station which I transferred from my bedroom where it's too 
    hot to work in the afternoons.)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCC99" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Days like 
    this that I work at home, I still find comfort in the the faint smell of yellow 
    Linseed oil and the sound of a well-worn paint brush swish-swish-swishing 
    on spolotchy stretched <a href="canvas.htm">canvas</a>.</font></p>
