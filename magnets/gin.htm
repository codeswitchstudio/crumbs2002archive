  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="6">It was 
    a Tuesday afternoon</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="4"> 
    when they took our class picture. Our classes start at about seven in the 
    morning. I lived a couple of blocks from school, so I was always early (since 
    I was a Freshman, even). That particular month (March), my classmates and 
    I had been smuggling liquor to school, hidden inside our bags, beneath stacks 
    of textbooks and PE uniforms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="4">There 
    was this one guy named Laurence who brought liquor inside his. That Tuesday, 
    he brought gin diluted in clear soda, about one part gin mixed with six parts 
    soda. There was too much soda, you could barely taste the gin in it. Some 
    classmates decided to jump the fence and buy more gin from a local store, 
    to give the drink a bit of kick.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="4">Half an 
    hour before our class picture taking, half of the boys in class were already 
    drunk (including me, but not shit-faced, yet. only red). Some were dozing 
    it off on their desks, some were still drinking, some were harassing the girls 
    in the class.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="4">They finally 
    took our picture, with half of the boys missing. I was in the picture, though, 
    <a href="red.htm">red as a strawberry</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCCC" size="4">And I 
    was smiling. -Juli</font></p>
