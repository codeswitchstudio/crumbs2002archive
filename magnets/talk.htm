  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">Tired 
    and drenched from the rain, </font><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Elise 
    and I sat on the steps and just talked about things. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">She tells 
    me of the time she gave birth to Leif and Enrico wasn't there by her side. 
    He was busy finishing his first major film. At the hospital, she says, everyone 
    hated her for being a mess and coming in at the last minute, with the baby 
    almost out. Her parents didn't approve of a half-Oriental baby either. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">For two 
    months she stayed at the commune, wearing herself out over the child. Soon 
    enough, she was overcome by the strain of getting up in the middle of the 
    night, feeding the baby, and changing his diapers. (How could she concentrate 
    on sculptures stained-glass art while the baby bawled for milk and attention?)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It was 
    fall when Enrico finally finished his film, Elise told him to take the kid 
    and be off. She thought she wanted to see the last of him and whatever they 
    shared together. So he drove off in his strange jeep, their little pink bundle 
    of a boy in the front seat.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Days later 
    the euphoria of her regained freedom turned to depression. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a href="phone.htm">It 
    took one phone call to change everything.</a> &quot;Want to go to with me 
    to the Philippines?&quot; Enrico said over the line. &quot;Ja!!!&quot; she 
    said without hesitation. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC6699" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Leif
    was 2 when his folks got married in the highlands. They had 12 sandwiches and rice 
    wine for the reception. Elise's heart hasn't really left the Third World ever 
    since.</font></p>
