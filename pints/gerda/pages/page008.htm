  <p><b><font size="+2">S</font><font size="2">aw the advert on a university rag 
    where a former classmate of mine used to write. I told him I was on the lookout 
    for creative writing workshops, and he told me he'd keep his eyes open. He 
    kept his promise and sent me a copy of the classified ads from his newspaper. 
    The advert told me to send a manuscript to a certain address in Malate. I 
    sent one, a short story about a homosexual page in Feudal France (don't ask. 
    I was younger), around ten pages, I think. </font></b></p>
