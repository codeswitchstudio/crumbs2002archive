    of the country. There was this old mansion on a cliff overlooking the South 
    China Sea, in the middle of all that green trees and grass, and then about 
    fifty paces west, the land disappears into a drop, into the sea.<br>
    </b></font><b><font size="2">And about five paces from the edge of the cliff 
    was this big mango tree. It was big, probably a hundred and fifty years old, 
    maybe even older, with leaves as big as my palm, fruits as big as my feet. 
    Well, that's what the caretaker told us. </font></b></p>
