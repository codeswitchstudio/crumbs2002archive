    I was in the Ortigas station, waiting for the north bound train, about fifteen 
    minutes before the MRT stations closed. I spent most of the day looking for 
    a book that I didn't even find. I was pretty frustrated (I bet you know how 
    that feels like), decided to go home. The second to the last train was coming 
    when I suddenly hear someone call my name from across the rails. It was a 
    familiar voice, knew it by heart, actually.</b></font></p>
