    pay for it.</i> She smiles at me, taking a moment to look at me. We stare 
    at each other. <i>Still so pretty,</i> I tell myself. <i>Still seventeen. 
    Should I kiss her?</i> I ask myself. I was considering it when she pulls something 
    out of her wallet and gives it to me. I take it.</font></b></p>
