    known a lot of girls before in high school. Shook their hands, talked to them, 
    dated some of them, got to kiss most of them. So, I'm pretty familiar with 
    the opposite sex's feel and smell and whathaveyou. You know what I'm talking 
    about. I bet even girls have had the same thing happen to them once or twice 
    in their lives, when the boys in their class (or workplace) stopped being 
    interesting and started becoming boring. It's been known to happen in marriages, 
    even.</b></font></p>
