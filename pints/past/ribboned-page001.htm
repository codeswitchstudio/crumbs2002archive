    My editor called me up early that day, asking me to come up with something 
    for the paper, fast. Pretty slow month for me, actually. Spent a good part 
    of it mostly drunk out of my mind. Moorcock wrote most of his sword-and-sorcery 
    books with bottles-worth of Jack Daniel's in his stomach, forced out two hundred 
    pages of stories about albinos with enchanted swords, just to pay the monthly 
    bills. Never did have the stomach for that sort of thing. Rush jobs, I mean.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hemingway used to do 
    that, too. And look where it got him. <b>Drinking, I mean.</b></font> </p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="page002.htm" target="_parent"><b>Was 
    looking through my files the other night</b></a>, looking for an old short 
    I wrote five years back. Story was about this group of astronauts finding 
    something really weird in an ice planet, a yellow-colored house in the middle 
    of a field of dandelions. Wrote it in this experimental form, the bastard 
    child of screenplay and novel forms. I was happy with it, but I decided it 
    was too weird for publication. Eventually used the same device in <b>THE ANCHOR 
    THROUGH THE CATTLE.</b> Was in the Post's bestseller's list for around a month 
    or two. Something like that.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What made me decide to 
    dig up this piece of private literature? <b>My editor pretty much has me by 
    my nads<font size="2">.</font></b> And she has very sharp fingers. I'll tell 
    you about that story at another time, perhaps.</font></p>
