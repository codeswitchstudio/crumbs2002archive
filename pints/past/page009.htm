  later, an artist friend of mine</font></b> drew up this experimental painting 
  of his, mixed-media. It was a picture of a girl transforming into a goddess. 
  He was an amateur artist back in those days, was one of the starving ones, too. 
  Anyway, he insisted on showing the painting to me. Being the great guy that 
  I was, <b>I agreed to see it</b>. Probably get a story out of it, so, why not? 
  I was doing this experiment, maybe every writer does this, but I was trying 
  to write stories about anything that struck my fancy. I know <b>Chesterton used 
  to do it, writing essays about a brown paper bag, about the contents of his 
  pockets, stuff like that</b>. I read it somewhere, and thought it was clever 
  and all, and <b>probably nice practice for a young writer</b>.</font></div>
<div id="Layer2" style="position:absolute; left:110px; top:275px; width:394px; height:59px; z-index:2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>I 
  wrote some about a homeless man that I used to see in the Park, about Saffron, 
  wrote one about my boss, one about my brother and his nocturnal activities. 
  </b> </font></div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; left:109px; top:379px; width:396px; height:115px; z-index:3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  Anyway, this particular painting (MY GIRL, mixed media on canvas, 1992, private 
  collection), the artist told me, was about <b>how some girls turn into goddesses, 
  even for but a second</b>. It's been known to happen, he told me. <font size="+1"><b>Back 
  in that classroom, when the door opened, <a href="page010.htm" target="_parent">I 
  saw a goddess.</a> </b></font></font></div>
