  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>&quot;It was 
  fun, you know?&quot; she thought out aloud. </b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
  were both in bed, on our sides, facing each other, the radio singing 'Diamond 
  Sea' in Thurston Moore's voice. Her things were packed and tucked under the 
  bed a few hours earlier. I even helped her pack, somewhat half-hearted. What 
  was fun? I asked her. She smiled her dimpled smile at me before answering. <font size="2"><b>&quot;Our 
  time together, dummy. It was fun. I had fun,&quot; she said</b></font>, and 
  she leaned towards me and gave me a kiss.</font></div>
<div id="Layer1" style="position:absolute; width:164px; height:269px; z-index:1; left: 459px; top: 61px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
  like that, she stood there in front of me. I raised the camera to my right eye 
  and took aim. Click, the Zenith went. I pulled the photograph out and waved 
  it to dry. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Azalea told me when the picture was clear. And 
  then she gave me a kiss, and after that, we made love one final time, the act 
  still as gentle and sweet and magical as our first time together. </font> 
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For every kiss 
    planted came a rain of quick pecks.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I fell asleep, 
    and when I woke up three hours later, <b><font size="2">she was gone.</font></b></font></p>

  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I reached out 
    for the table behind me and felt for a pack of Camels and a blue Cricket lighter.</font> 
    <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A tap and a light, 
    and I was smoking a stick between my lips. As I turned back to face Azalea, 
    I found her naked and on her feet by the window, the bedsheets draped on her 
    shoulders, the Zenith in hand, facing me. &quot;Smile, Siddharta,&quot; she 
    told me in a whisper, and then took my picture. Something <b><font size="2">caught 
    my eye</font></b> just then</font>.</p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I sat up on the 
    bed and took the camera from her. Just stand there, I told her. I have the 
    best shot, here. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    </font></p>

  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I slipped the Polaroids 
  back into the pages of the book, and I slipped the book into the stack behind 
  me, between a book about Origami and my hardcover copy of 'the Elephant Vanishes'. 
  </font> 
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Days later, Saffron 
    was shuffling through the Kama Sutra when she found the Polaroids. &quot;Who's 
    this girl?&quot; she asked me, waving Azalea's picture in the air. That? I 
    asked her. She nodded.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A girl I knew 
    once, back in college&#133; I told her, leaving it hanging. </font></p>

  she have a name?&quot; she asks me after a second or two. I nodded, saying Yeah, 
  she does. &quot;What's her name, then?&quot; </font> 
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Azalea, I told 
    Saffron. She smiled and nodded, as if she understood, as if enlightened.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Az-za-le-ah,&quot; 
    Saffron repeated the name, letting the name linger on her lips like sweet 
    cream soda aftertaste.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She slipped the 
    Polaroids back into the book, and placed the book back into the stack. She 
    looked back at me and smiled.</font></p>
