    old stuff from my parents' home. They were cleaning-out the place, decided 
    to run an inventory check of sorts on everything inside the house. They even 
    made lists on what to give out, what to pass on to friends and family. </font></p>

  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wide books, they 
  were. Two were Belgian BDs: Herge's 'Tintin and the Prisoners of the Sun' and 
  'the Crab with the Golden Claws'. BDs from my childhood. I put them on top of 
  the stack beside me, so I could show it to Saffron later. </font>

    and whatever Brit fashion rag there was (my ma's); fantasy paperbacks like 
    the 'Thomas Covenant' series, some early Moorcock, and some sci-fi, too. There's 
    the occasional Japanese novel, some Anais Nin, some history books&#133; a 
    nice collection, all told. And all mine.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thursday that 
    same week, even after Saffron dropped by to help me with the books, I was

  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the next Monday,
