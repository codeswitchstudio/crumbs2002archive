  first read the Kama Sutra when I was 16, summer of 86</font></b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">. 
  Naturally, I heard about it from friends in school, about how it had extensive 
  step-by-step walkthroughs on different positions on having sex, and that it 
  had pictures, too. Being male and 16, it piqued me interest like a bloodhound 
  to a rabbit. I started looking for it in libraries and bookstores. Never found 
  it at those places, but I did discover the joys and frustrations of book hunting 
  that summer. Discovered the joys of book reading, too. But that's another story.</font></div>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">So, 
    one day, I was scanning through my uncle's book catalogue. He used to get 
    these really thick book catalogues, from Classical Lit to Encyclopedias to 
    Biographies to Science Fiction to Erotica. I first tried looking for the book 
    in the Erotica catalogue. Didn't find it there, but I did get a somewhat 'quick 
    fix' on the pictures and excerpts.<br>
    <br>
    Tired and sweaty, I decided to scan through the Classic Lit catalogue, maybe 
    make my uncle order some newly pressed editions of the Brothers K, I was thinking. 
    I've all but given up when I happened upon the books under letter K. </font></p>

<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; width:160px; height:197px; z-index:3; left: 454px; top: 61px"> 
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#000000">and 
    <b><font size="2">the first book my eyes fell upon was the Kama Sutra</font></b>. 
    After a bit of persuasion, my uncle bought the book for me, under the condition 
    that I was not to tell my parents about it, and that I were to hand the book 
    to him after I finish reading it, and that I use the Knowledge within the 
    Kama Sutra for the Greater Good of Society.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">With 
    a smile and a shake of hands, I agreed. A month or so later, I was deep into 
    the book. Much to my disappointment, the book I got wasn't illustrated, and 
    it didn't have the extensive </font></p>

  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">step-by-step 
    walkthroughs.It had rather interesting parts, though, like the part where 
    I figured that <b><font size="2">2,000 years ago, the Indians were already 
    into a rather tame form of S&M.</font></b> I breezed through the book, and 
    when I was done with it, I gave it to my uncle, who was also disappointed, 
    funnily enough. I think he was more disappointed by it than I was. </font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The 
    book I got that Wednesday was a new version, not 10 years old. In it were 
    the three Erotica books that Sir Richard Burton translated for the English 
    way back in the late 1800s:</font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#000000">the 
    Kama Sutra (which was written around the same time Saint John was tripping 
    on mushrooms in themountain), the Ananga-Ranga (written when Columbus stumbled 
    unto America),and the Scented Garden (written by a dirty old man from Turkey, 
    according to the editor). </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">And 
    for the life of me, I couldn't remember ever buying this edition. I turned 
    to the first page, looking for the owner's name, but found none. I was scanning 
    through it rapidly with my thumb when several Polaroids, apparently kept between 
    the pages of the book, flew out of it and scattered all over the living room 
    carpet. Curious, I crawled to the Polaroids and scanned through them like 
    a deck of cards. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">First 
    one was a picture of me, a bit of a candid shot, a fag between my lips.</font></p>

  <font color="#000000">Nice effect in the picture was that <b><font size="2">it 
  looked like a still form a movie</font></b>. It was grainy and fuzzy in all 
  the right places. The picture got me to thinking: who'd take a picture of me 
  smoking? Obviously, the picture had to be at least 5 years old, as I haven't 
  touched a stick of smokes in a dog's age, now. It also looked like it was early 
  morning when the picture was taken, which means that I slept with the girl who 
  took the picture (thinking it was a girl who took the photograph, as I've never 
  ever slept with a man before in me entire life. </font></font></div>

  near as I can remember, at least). The second Polaroid answered my questions: 
  it was a picture of this girl I knew about 7 or 8 years ago. She was naked in 
  the picture, but it was so cleverly taken, that the shadows and the bedsheets 
  were concealing and showcasing all the right parts: a hint of a nipple here, 
  a small corner of pubic hair there, her hair brushing by her shoulders, covering 
  a bit of the side of her face and body, the sides of her small perfect breasts, 
  her lips and nipple scarlet on her pale Japanese skin.</font></div>

  standing by the window in the photograph, the window that overlooked this small 
  lake beside the house where I used to board in back in college. The bedsheets 
  draped on her shoulders, worn more like a feathered boa than a cape. The sky 
  outside the window, seen through the gaps between the wooden blinds, is violet 
  and pink, the colors of a strange sunrise. I remember that day. Right before 
  she left for Canada. I turned to lie on my back, thinking. Azalea. God. <b><font size="2"><a href="btwindow3.htm" target="_parent">That 
  was one girl I haven't thought about in years&gt;&gt;&gt;. </a></font></b></font></div>
