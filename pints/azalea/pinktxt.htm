<div id="Layer1" style="position:absolute; width:157px; height:262px; z-index:1; left: 17px; top: 61px"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I 
  met Azalea in college.</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  She was an exchange student from Singapore, studying Anthropology. She was one 
  of this group of 10 students from across South-East Asia who were brought in 
  as an International Friendship Gesture of sorts: the rest of South-East Asia 
  welcomed Filipinos, and in turn, we welcomed our Foreign Neighbors with open 
  arms. In hindsight, I think that the source of my attraction to Azalea was her 
  being foreign. Like with Gerda, Azalea was like a whole new country for me. 
  She was Erika and Miss Min-Mei and Cio-Cio San.</font></div>
<div id="Layer2" style="position:absolute; width:160px; height:252px; z-index:2; left: 237px; top: 63px">
  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> She was sushi 
    and wasabe and sake. <font size="2"><font size="1">She was Japan.</font><b> 
    </b></font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>"Sid-dhar-ta," 
    she read my name aloud,</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    first time we met, pronouncing each syllable not too fast, not too slow, my 
    name dancing on her lips. Perfectly, in that wonderful English accent of hers, 
    classy and refined. Az-za-le-ah, I read her name in turn, letting it linger 
    like sweet cream soda aftertaste. She smiled and I smiled, and for some reason 
    we both laughed at our mutual fondness of each other's names.</font></p>
</div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; width:157px; height:254px; z-index:3; left: 460px; top: 64px"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  week after our first meeting, we were going out. And slowly but surely, I discovered 
  Azalea's many depths and heights: her favorite band (Sonic Youth), her favorite 
  book (Perfume), her favorite song (Sonic Youth's 'Diamond Sea')&#133; you know. 
  Things you find out in dates. Small details that make the other person more 
  human, more complex. Details that make them richer in your eyes. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Two weeks after 
    we met, that's when we first slept together. The act was gentle, like a dance, 
    every movement meant </font></p>
</div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; width:199px; height:254px; z-index:3; left: 679px; top: 68px"> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">to please and 
    excite us both. For every kiss planted came a rain of quick pecks. The both 
    of us were up all night. It was magical.</font></p>
  <p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She fascinated 
    me, her every movement, hell, her whole body and mind <font size="2"></font><b><font size="2">were 
    like spells meant to enthrall me:</font></b> how she raised her hand to brush 
    away a stray strand of hair, how her chest moved when she sighed while asleep, 
    how her bottom lip trembled when we kissed, how her tongue would touch her 
    teeth when she said my name, how soft her lips were when we kissed, how she 
    made little half-yelps when she came.</font></p>
</div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; width:245px; height:254px; z-index:3; left: 927px; top: 68px"> 
  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were in the mall 
  one day, and she saw this photo camera called a Zenith. She instantly fell in 
  love with it, and she asked me to buy it for her, as she didn't have enough 
  money with her. Of course, I was more than happy to pay for it. So, we bought 
  it. <b><font size="2">We took pictures of everything and everyone: Mang Mario, 
  the old man with the eyes of a Chihuahua tending his store; Cherry with her 
  cousin-girlfriend Alex, in an erotic embrace; Mark playing chess by himself.</font></b> 
  We posted the photographs all over our room, in chronological order. Interesting 
  thing about it was, you could see that Azalea's skill (she took most of the 
  pictures) improved every two photographs taken. </font></div>
<div id="Layer4" style="position:absolute; width:149px; height:115px; z-index:4; left: 1239px; top: 64px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'll 
  be leaving for Canada in a week's time, Sid." Azalea told me one Saturday in 
  the park. We were taking pictures of homeless people that week. Canada? For 
  how long? I asked her, fanning one photograph in the air. "I'm not sure. I learned 
  about it just last week. I've been trying to work up the courage to tell you…" 
  she left the sentence<font size="2"></font><b><font size="2"> unfinished</font></b>. 
  Back at our place, no one mentioned a word about it for about a week, up until 
  our last night together, before she <a href="btwindow4.htm" target="_parent">reported 
  back to her embassy. &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></font></div>
