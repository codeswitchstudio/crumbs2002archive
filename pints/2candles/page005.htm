  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Oh, I think 
    you'd like this one, Sid. She's smart and classy and she writes for this magazine…" 
    he told me, his voice drifting. "A bit like you, I guess." Rhoda pitched in.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What's her zodiac 
    sign? I asked Rhoda. "She's a Scorpio. You're a Pisces, right?" she asked 
    me. I nodded. <i>Yeah, I'm a Pisces</i>. "The perfect pair, near as I can 
    tell: both dreamers and hungry for life and love," Rhoda began, cracking her 
    knuckles as she talked. She pulled out these rather beaten-up pages of bond 
    paper, held together by a staple. It had star charts and dates and numbers 
    and arcane symbols throughout. I actually gave them to her, photocopies of 
    this astrology </font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">book I found 
    in the library. After about a week or so, she was giving horoscopes and love 
    compatibility charts to everyone in sight, for free. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The perfect 
    pair," Rhoda continued. "as both are aware of life's bittersweet nature, it's 
    cruelty and wonders, giving them both a bit of optimism in face of trials 
    and whatnot. The Deep Scorpio and the Dreaming Pisces, combined they are soulful, 
    meditative and persuasive. For Pisces, sex is a religion, and Scorpio is more 
    than happy to indulge that line of worship. Relationship is best in Love, 
    worst in Marriage."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><a href="page006.htm" target="_parent">Marriage?</a></i> 
    I asked her with mock-wide eyes. <i>Let's not get excited, here, Rhoda. I 
    don't mind a lover, but a wife? I'm only twenty-three, you know.</i> "Dummy!" 
    she said with a smile, </font></p>
