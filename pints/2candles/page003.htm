    RHODA, </b> from UPLB. They were inseparable, the two of them: Elvin the silently 
    glamorous, yet refined Chinoy homosexual, with his white polos and black slacks 
    and prescription glasses; and Rhoda the loud exotic-erotic beauty, with her 
    long hippie skirts and red Chuck Taylor's and baby-tees and her blue maong 
    jacket. Like pasta and cheese, like pancakes and maple syrup, one completing 
    the other. They were quite a pair.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I remember this 
    smile she had, a sly one, as if she knows that your underwear has a dime-sized 
    hole by the left butt cheek, or that you fantasize about her at cold nights 
    with your fist, or that you've been stirring up her roommate, trying to get 
    into her knickers. She had that sort of smile. A wink-wink nudge-nudge sort 
    of smile.</font></p>

    was a geeky-looking kid</a>, pale and thin, and being half-Chinese, he had 
    small eyes, which were even smaller than normal as he always wore these glasses
