    WAS UP ALL NIGHT </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">last 
    Saturday, drinking with a few friends of mine. It was Gerard's birthday, and 
    we were drinking gin as it was the only thing in his cabinet, and everyone 
    in the room was either too broke or too tight-arsed to spend money on drinks. 
    The thing was, gin always did make me a bit sick in the stomach (and in the 
    head, a few moments after).</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Late Sunday morning, 
    and my head is in the toilet when the 'phone rang. I let it ring for a while, 
    the siren a bit louder in my head, reverberating. I reach for the 'phone on 
    the sixth or seventh ring.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Hello?</i> 
    I groan into the receiver. My mouth tastes like something died in it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Sid? It's Saffron. 
    What took you so long to answer the bloody 'phone?" Saffron asks me through 
    the 'phoneline. <i>I was in the toilet,</i> I tell her. <i>Was out drinking 
    with Gerard and Marc and…</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Have you seen 
    today's newspaper, yet? You still get the papers, right?" she asks me, interrupting 
    my thread of thought. <i>Uh-huh.</i> Too hung-over to argue, I walk to the 
    door and look for that day's papers. I find it outside the apartment door.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still held together 
    by rubber band, I pick it up and plop on down the couch to read it. <i><a href="page002.htm" target="_parent">What 
    am I supposed to see?</a></i> I ask Saffron. "Is it the Inquirer?" she asks 
    me. Yeah, it is. "Front page, top-left hand side corner, small box beside 
    the title."</font></p>
