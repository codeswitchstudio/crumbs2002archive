  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "When did we 
    last see them?" Saffron asks, the question addressed more to herself than 
    to me. "Was it last year? They invited us up to Baguio, remember?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They were taking 
    care of this place there, and it was empty for the weekend… " I nod. I remember. 
    Rhoda and I fooled around a bit, that weekend.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You should remember, 
    as you and Rhoda fooled around a bit that weekend." <i>What?</i> I ask her, 
    a bit shocked. <i>How… how did you know?</i> She laughs, hand over her mouth. 
    "You thought I didn't know? How could I NOT know? We were watching the telly, 
    Elvin and I, and we couldn't help but hear the two of you rut like animals 
    on the second floor. I mean, we could hear bangings and footsteps and grunts. 
    Elvin and I were giggling</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> like high school 
    girls, man." Bangings? Footsteps? Grunts? She laughs again. "I didn't know 
    who to feel sorry for, her or you." she says with a smile, and the two of 
    us laugh together.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She stands up 
    and walks to her radio and turns it on. Astrud comes out of the stereo speakers. 
    "Once, I loved…" Saffron sings with it a bit, about five seconds or so before 
    she breaks out in tears. I walk to her and embrace her from behind. "No</font> 
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">one deserved to 
    die that way, Sid. Especially not Elvin and Rhoda. Especially not Elvin and 
    Rhoda… god…" she says between sobs. I feel tears running down my cheeks. She 
    turns around, facing me, and we stare into each other's eyes. Her nose and 
    eyes are pink from crying, three pink spots in a wonderfully pale face. <a href="page010.htm" target="_parent">I 
    kiss her on her forehead, on her eyes, on her nose, and on both cheeks.</a></font></p>
