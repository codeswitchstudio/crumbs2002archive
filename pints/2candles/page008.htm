    I call to her as soon as I was inside her place. On the way, I bought three 
    six-packs of beer. "In here, my room." she calls out to me. I walk to her 
    kitchen and shove the beer inside the fridge.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What did you 
    buy?" she asks me as I enter her room. Despite the situation, I smile at the 
    way her room smells. It hits me in a way that warm wind hits you when you 
    come out of a cold theater, or if you come </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">out 
    of an air-conditioned office. The room smells feminine. Soft powder and faint</font></p>

    up in bed, over her blankets, her head and back against the wall. She's still

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>I bought beer. 
    They're in the kitchen.</i> She nods, and I notice that her eyes are still 
    watery. Red and watery. "In bottles?" I shake my head rather disappointedly. 
    <i>In can.</i> She sticks her tongue out. I smile. <i>Had no choice, as they 
    were all in cans.</i> She smiles. "They'll do, don't worry." And with that 
    she stands up and walks towards the door. Reluctantly, I follow her.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>I still can't 
    wrap my brain on it, Saffron. I mean, Elvin and Rhoda. <a href="page009.htm" target="_parent">Dead, 
    just like that.</a></i> I tell her while we drink around the kitchen counter.</font></p>
