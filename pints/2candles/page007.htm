  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> voice, I remember 
    thinking. Right then and there, whatever worry I had flew away like bats from 
    a cave. In the back of my head, I hoped that the owner of the voice was the 
    girl I was supposed to talk to.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Hello,</i> 
    I answered back. <i>I'm looking for someone named Saffron…</i> "Speaking. 
    Who's this?" she asked me playfully. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Too 
    playfully, I thought. She must've known about me. Expecting my call, even. 
    <i>This is Siddharta. Elvin and Rhoda's friend.</i> "Ah." she answered. I 
    saw her smile through the 'phone.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>"They were 
    kidnapped</i></b> about a week ago, while they were on their way to school." 
    Saffron tells me, sobbing. I'm still in shock, the reality of it all not yet 
    kicking in.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Any witnesses?</i> 
    I ask. "There were a few, but all they said was that there was this blue… 
    fuck, what's the point, Sid? They're dead. Dead in Cavite. The Inquirer said 
    they were the sixth and seventh victims of kidnapping this year. They reduced 
    them into a statistic, into a fucking group of numbers and graphs. A fucking 
    statistic. Elvin and Rhoda. Dead in Cavite."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Are you home, 
    Saffron? Where are you?</i> I ask. There is a pause, about a second or so 
    of stifled sobs. "Yeah… yeah, I'm home."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I'll nip on 
    down there a bit, okay, Saffron? I… I need someone to talk to… </i>I left 
    the sentence hanging. She picks it up. "… okay. I won't go anywhere. Come. 
    Now. I need to talk, too."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a href="page008.htm" target="_parent">Okay. 
    I'll bring some beer, okay?</a></i></font></p>
