    back when the Gammas ruled the Main Hall steps. I took this for their anniversary 
    (T-Max 400, Natural Light.) There's Doreen with the long brown hair and white 
    shirt. No she wasn't a Gamma Sis. The Gamma chicks --yeah, those girls still 
    wear tight shirts and red lipstick--- they tried to recruit her. She was gonna 
    be one of them until the Galvez incident happened.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay now. That 
    one in the striped collared shirt was her boyfriend, high profile Gamma brod 
    Yñaki Galvez Junior. Pretentious macho shit almost got killed in that famous 
    rumble (the one that caused admin to ban vendors from selling bottled drinks 
    near the parking lot.) The Alphas bashed his head in with a lead pipe and 
    turned his dad's white Volvo into sheet metal. Contrary to rumors, he suffered 
    no brain damage. But then, Yñaki-boy had no brains to begin with anyway. </font></b></font></p>
