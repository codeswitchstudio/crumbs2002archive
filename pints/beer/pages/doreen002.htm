    Doreen Vista back in college.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Svelte and petite, 
    she drove us guys nuts but if you stared hard at her long enough, or at least 
    as much as I had, she wasn't really beautiful. Her eyes were so small and 
    almost assymmetrical, always darting to and fro, scrutinizing the room; perhaps 
    to see if she was being seen. Up close, her skin was so pale you could see 
    delicate pink spider webs beneath her cheeks. Doreen's teeth were so long 
    she actually brandished them during those rare times she smiled in my direction.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You could say 
    I followed her around but not in a deliberate way, like a pathetic stalker 
    would. Doreen just always turned up in my photos as she jumped from one circle 
    of people to another. Here, wait. Lemme get my clearbook and show you. </font></b></font></p>
