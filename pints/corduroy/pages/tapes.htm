  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="+1">The 
    sound of galloping horses woke me up.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rain was falling all 
    over the city in raindrops as big as buckets, the roof was rattling like stallions 
    were trampling on it. Found my wristwatch: eight o'clock, it told me. Eight 
    in the PM, and it was raining. I stand up and walk to the 'phone, thinking 
    about canceling the party, and was greeted by the answerphone's blinking red 
    light. <i>Someone left a message</i>, my still sleepy head told me. <i>Why, 
    yes, indeed,</i> I answered back. <i>Someone left a message.</i> I pressed 
    the answerphone rewind button. Stop. Play. Listen.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Hey, Sid, it's Gerard," 
    the answerphone told me in Gerard's voice. "Sorry I can't go to the party, 
    man. Rain and all, fucked up our driveway like anything. The flood's up to 
    my knees, man. Anyway, maybe next week? A drink-up? Okay. Oh yeah, happy birthday!"</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*beep*</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Sid, love, it's Robin 
    here. Sorry we can't make it to your place. Rain's just too hard right now. 
    Maybe when it clears up? Anyway, I'll call you up later. Happy birthday!"</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*beep*</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Your bro, Sid. Rain's 
    too awful for me to commute down to your place. Sorry. I know I promised you 
    stuff, take you down to the zoo or something. Maybe next week? With Sean and 
    Nicholas, maybe? Happy birthday, okay? Yeah."</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*beep*</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"'Ey shit-for-brains 
    birthday boy! Flood down here's up to me nostrils, man. The river's swelling 
    like hell, and David needs help with the rotten plumbing job here. Rain's 
    been puking sewage out of every drainage in the house, it already smells like 
    Farmer's Market in the bumper end, man. it has to be smelt to be belie--"</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>And it went on and 
    on, message after message. Keywords were "sorry" and "rain" and "birthday". 
    Looking out my window, I was actually pretty relieved. It was a bit like a 
    squall outside. Quite the sight, I thought. Went to the kitchen, took out 
    one box of pizza, went to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of beer. <i>Fuck 
    those guys, </i>I thought. <i>And fuck the rain while I'm at it. I'll enjoy 
    the night by myself, and with bloody DREAMS on the VCR. </i></b></font></p>
