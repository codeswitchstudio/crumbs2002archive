  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">It was THE WEEPING 
    DEMON when the doorbell rang.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">With about thirty 
    "I'm sorry" messages in the answerphone, I wasn't expecting anyone coming 
    to my birthday. Still in my underwear, I walk to the bed to put on my pants, 
    shouting <i>Hold on!</i> over my shoulder. I open the door. </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"What took you 
    so long to answer the door?" It's Saffron, soaking with rainwater.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>I was in my 
    underwear,</i> I tell her. <i>I had to wear a pair.</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I let her in, 
    helping her remove her brown corduroy jacket. I remember buying this for her, 
    way back, as a token of appreciation. Bought it from this bargain place beside 
    an army base. Saffron and I were there, doing research for this photos collection 
    book we were doing. It was her contact, and I was looking for a job. Asked 
    me if I wanted one for the summer. I was just starting then. Said yes, and 
    got paid up front, one of my first cheques. Was happy, felt immensely indebted 
    to her.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">We saw the bargain 
    place when we were looking for a nice spot to shoot these army jeeps (black 
    against gray). Like a satellite to a planet, she gravitated towards the bargain 
    bins automatically, like they were soulmates. Digging into the bins and boxes 
    full of clothes, she pulled out this beaten-up brown corduroy jacket. She 
    put it on and did a little twirl (like a ballerina), a smile of bliss plastered 
    on her face. I smiled and walked towards the shopkeeper. <i>How much for that 
    jacket?</i> I asked her. "One hundred fifty, ho" she answered me. I pulled 
    out three fifty peso bills, crisp like dead leaves, and I paid for the jacket.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"As if I haven't 
    seen you in your drawers before!" she tells me as I go to the laundry room 
    with the dripping jacket. She follows me, her clothes drip-drip-dripping water 
    on the floor. <i>Take those things off,</i> I tell her, pointing at her shirt 
    and pants. <i>You'll die of pneumonia if you're not careful. </i>"Yeah, yeah" 
    she mumbles, taking off her shirt. I walk to the closet, got my KISS ME shirt 
    and a pair of pajama bottoms I haven't used for years. Trying not to look, 
    I hand it to her. <i>Here, wear these things instead,</i> I say. <i>Shove 
    your things in the dryer and turn it on.</i> </font></b></font></p>
