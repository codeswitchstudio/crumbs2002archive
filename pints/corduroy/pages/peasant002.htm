  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">I wake up the 
    next morning, the sun finally up and out, the rain gone.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I glance at my 
    wristwatch, telling me it's one o'clock in the afternoon. I rub my face with 
    my tee-shirt, and then walk to the bed to check on Saffron. She's not there. 
    In her place I find a pile of clothes, my KISS ME tee-shirt and old pajama 
    bottoms, and a gift-wrapped package. The wrapping she used was yesterday's 
    newspaper. I pick up the package and open it. Inside is a CD. The cover has 
    a photograph of two girls on it, cleverly taken. At first glance, you'd think 
    it was a shot of a girl looking at a mirror, when it's actually a shot of 
    two girls staring at each other, possibly twins. It's Belle & Sebastian's 
    FOLD YOUR HANDS CHILD, YOU WALK LIKE A PEASANT. With the disc is a note folded 
    in half, with my name written on it. It was written with the girly childish 
    scribble of Saffron's handwriting. I fold it open.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Sid," Saffron 
    tells me through the note. "Last night was fun. Sorry about your party, but 
    it did give us time to catch up on things. Thought about waking you up, to 
    talk to you personally, but you were sleeping so soundly, like a baby, I didn't 
    have the heart to wake you up. Bought you the new B&S disc!! Play track number 
    five for me. Anyway, again: Happy birthday. Call me?" and she ends it with 
    a red kiss mark on the side, and below it she wrote her name: "Saffron".</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I walk to the 
    stereo and insert the disc. Program it to track number five, and then press 
    play. A melancholy song comes out of the speakers.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Don't leave 
    the light on, baby… I'll see you sometime, maybe… don't leave the light on, 
    baby…"</font></b></font></p>
