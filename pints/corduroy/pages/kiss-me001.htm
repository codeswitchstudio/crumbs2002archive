  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I pull out two

    and my old pajama bottoms. I smile and point to the bottle of beer. <i>Yours,</i> 
    I say.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Thanks," she 
    tells me. She raises the bottle to her lips, drinking. Her eyebrows then rise, 
    as if she remembers something. "You still have this shirt," she tells me, 
    pulling at the KISS ME shirt. <i>Yeah,</i> I answer back. Oh yeah. Saffron 
    bought me that shirt from the same bargain place where we got her corduroy 
    jacket. <i>And you still have the jacket, </i>I tell her. "Uh-huh," she tells 
    me through the bottle. <i>There's pizza in the oven, </i>I tell her. <i>I'm 
    reheating it. Molten cheese and all.</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Mmm, molten 
    cheese! You know the shape of my heart, Sid!" she tells me in her bright, 
    sparkling voice. <i>Of course I do,</i> I tell her, opening the oven door. 
    <i>I spent about a year and a half of my life beside it, </i>I say with a 
    smile. "Silly boy!" she says, pinching my nose. The oven pings. I open it 
    and pull out the pizza. As soon as I open the oven door, Saffron takes a generous 
    whiff of the hot air drifting from the inside. "Let's eat it in the living 
    room!" Saffron tells me. I nod, and she runs off to the living room, bottle 
    of beer in hand, wearing my KISS ME shirt and pajama bottoms. The smell of 
    molten cheese drifts off behind her. </font></b></font></p>
