    player, and the credits were already rolling when we got to the sofa.</font></b></p>

    scene, "Dreams?" she asks me. I nod. <i>Yeah, it is.</i></font></b></p>

    it? Sad and beautiful in all the right places." <i>Yeah,</i> I say, putting 
    the pizza on top of the table. Saffron looks around the place, her eyes jumping 
    from </font></b></p>

  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Does that thing 
    still play?" she asks me, pointing at the stereo. I nod. <i>Yeah, cassette 
    and CD. Look for something nice, </i>I tell her. She walks to the stack of 
    CDs beside the player, shuffling through them with ease, like they were cards. 
    Her hands are long, as she was in the rather thin and tall side. She finds 
    one she likes, pushes a button to open the CD tray, and puts the CD in. Press 
    play, and I hear 'The State I Am In'.</font></b></font></p>

    I was happy for a day, in 1975… I was puzzled by a dream, stayed with me all 
    day, in 1995…" she turns around slowly and sings with the CD, using the beer 
    bottle as a faux-microphone, Sufi-dancing with the tune. I smile and drink 
    and remind her: <i>Oi, Tigermilk. You bought me that disc.</i></font></b></font></p>

    for worthwhile records back then:</font><font size="2"> BIS, SUPER FURRY ANIMALS, 
    that WEEZER Pinkerton album… the two of us were shuffling through bargain 
    shelves of CDs in a place called Chapel. Shuffling through CDs of artists 
    with names like SCHOOL BOYS, PINK TRIANGLE, ELEPHANT BABIES, and several anthologies 
    and soundtracks. Saffron pulled out a CD from the shelf, walked to the counter, 
    and paid for it.</font></b></font></p>

  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hold out 
    your hand," she said. I held it out and she put the CD on top of it, telling 
    me "For you. Try this one. Heard it back when I was in Glasgow, I think you'll 
    love it." When I got home, went straight to the player and pressed play. Flew 
    up to heaven with the album, never really came back. </font></b></font></p>

    we both drink our beer. </font></b></font></p>
