  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1"><i>Every party 
    comes to this,</i> I tell her.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">She takes this 
    as a cue to pay attention. Already have six bottles in my stomach, Saffron 
    has four in hers. Think it's time to get philosophical.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>Every party 
    comes to this, </i>I tell her. <i>Time comes when there're only two people, 
    sharing a bottle of whisky, or maybe JD, or maybe each cradling a bottle of 
    beer, just like what we're doing right now. Shooting the bull. Getting shit-faced. 
    Drinking up.</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Ah," Saffron 
    butts in on the temporary pause in my train of thought. "but your party started 
    with only TWO people!" I smile.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>Every party 
    starts with two people, Saffron,</i> I tell her. <i>The party-thrower, and 
    the first guest. In our case, the party-thrower and the first and only guest. 
    But anyway, I get your point.</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"You always do," 
    she tells me. She smiles, walks to the player and changes the disc in the 
    middle of 'Electronic Renaissance'. She presses some buttons, skipping over 
    the other songs of whatever it is she put in there. She stops, presses play.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">'If you want 
    me I'll be there, a boy to deal with all your problems… but part of the deal 
    is, for you to feel something…" the player sings. I recognize the song, and 
    I nod my head with it. Saffron does her Sufi dance again, and I try to sing 
    with it, failing rather miserably. The two of us laugh. In the dryer, her 
    clothes spin and tumble and dry.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>You know, 
    how when people hear a song, and deep in their hearts of hearts, they recognize 
    a song to be THEIR song, and in their private moments, or maybe when riding 
    a bus and some stupid song's blaring on the speakers, or maybe when they're 
    at work, or maybe before going to sleep, they sing the song to themselves. 
    You know that?</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Saffron nods, 
    saying "Yeah."</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>Well, this 
    song was my song for a year,</i> I tell her.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"If you want 
    me all you have to do, is ask a thousand questions, triplicate and file… under 
    'Simple things you ask to make a… YOUNG BOY SIGH', a YOUNG BOY SIGH, a YOUNG 
    BOY SIGH…" I sing with it, and Saffron sings with me. </font></b></font></p>
