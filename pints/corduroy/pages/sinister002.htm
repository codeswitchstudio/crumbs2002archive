  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">And then the 
    dryer tells us Saffron's clothes are dry.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">The two of us 
    try to stand up and walk to the dryer. Saffron pulls out her clothes from 
    the machine, and straightens them out. She smiles approvingly, eyeing her 
    clothes. She looks back at me with a smile, her eyes smiling with her. I remember 
    that, I think to myself. "They're dry," she tells me, stating the obvious. 
    I glance at my wristwatch, and it says eleven-thirty. <i>You still want to 
    go home?</i> I ask her. She asks me what time it is, and I tell her. She frowns, 
    and touches her nose, feeling it with her hand.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Then, she turns 
    to me and asks "Can I sleep over? I'm too drunk to go home…" I nod, telling 
    her <i>Of course. You can use my bed. I can sleep on the sofa.</i></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"How about two 
    more bottles before we go to sleep?" she asks me. I shrug my shoulders. <i>Why 
    not?</i> We walk to the fridge and pull out two more bottles of beer, ice-cold, 
    colder than our previous bottles. I pass her a bottle, and we walk back to 
    the living room. She walks to the stereo and changes the disc. Pressed play, 
    and Stuart and Co. starts singing in the stereo. 'Judy and the Dream of Horses'. 
    <i>A sweet song.</i> We plop on down the sofa.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I pull my head 
    back, and the room moves with me. <i>I'm drunk,</i> I tell Saffron. She laughs, 
    and says "Me too. How much beer did we drink, anyway?" she asks me. I look 
    at the table and concentrate, counting the empty bottles. <i>I think I drank 
    six, and you had five. This is my seventh, and that's your sixth. </i>She 
    nods and smiles. She stares at her bottle, half-empty.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Mine's half-empty." 
    Saffron tells me.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>No it's not, 
    </i>I tell her. <i>It's half-full.</i> She laughs out loud. I could hear her 
    thoughts saying "Silly boy!!"</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">"How about a 
    toast, Sid?</font><font size="2"> I mean, it is your birthday, and the two 
    of us are drinking… perfect set-up for a bloody great toast."</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>A toast? A 
    toast to what?</i> I ask. She smiles.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"I already thought-up 
    of one, actually" she says.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>Out with it, 
    then! </i>We lift our beer and hold them in mid-air, an inch apart. She clears 
    her throat.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"To rusty aerials, 
    and… what was the other one?"</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2"><i>Uh… absent 
    stars?</i> I suggest.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">"Brilliant!! 
    God, I'm pissed-face!! To rusty aerials, and absent stars," she says with 
    a satisfied smile. A clink and two swigs.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">And then she 
    drifts off to sleep with a smile on her face.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">I push her gently, 
    trying to wake her up.</font><font size="2"> No success. I stand up, my knees 
    a bit wobbly, and I move towards her. I carry her (she's so light! Or maybe 
    it's that temporary strength that beer gives us) to the bed, and I cover her 
    with the blankets. She curls by reflex, and mumbles something in her sleep. 
    "Happy birthday, Sid." And then she smiles.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">I walk to the 
    sofa (my bed for the night!) and I finish my bottle, and then Saffron's. I 
    sleep while sitting up. </font></b></font></p>
