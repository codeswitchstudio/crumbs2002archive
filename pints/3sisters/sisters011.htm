    not?" she says. "Let me finish this first," she points to her beer. "and then 
    we go to my place." I nod and finish mine. The barkeep changed the music, 
    and now I hear 'Simple Things', Belle & Sebastian. Walking to the toilet, 
    I hum with it. Coming back to the table, and still humming, I see Robin already 
    outside. I pull out my notebook and pen, scribble a small note on one sheet, 
    and give it to the barkeep.</font></b></p>

    <i>In case Saffron comes tonight, give this to her,</i> I tell the guy. He 
    nods and makes the sheet disappear somewhere below the bar. Pulling out my 
    wallet, the barkeep tells me that Robin already paid for the beer. I shrug, 
    and then exit THE THREE SISTERS, to enter Robin's place.</font></b></font></p>

    her hands when we made love, applying bits of pressure here and there, now 
    and then, again and again. That, and her muscle contractions always did drive 
    me to the edge.</font></font></b></p>

    eyes crawl up, towards her face. She catches my eyes with hers. She smiles 
    while drinking. I smile, noticing that my third pint's almost up. I give my 
    watch another glance. 11:15. Still no Saffron.</font></b></p>
