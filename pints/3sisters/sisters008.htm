    two of you still together?&quot; her eyes are sparkling. When we were together, 
    Robin changed the color of her contact lenses everyday. She had red, green, 
    yellow, blue, orange, black and white. My favorite was this printed pair. 
    They had sunflowers on them, each lens looking like a sunflower. She changed 
    them according to her mood. She wore her red pair when we decided to cool 
    off for a while. When we decided to hook up again, she had sunflowers in her 
    eyes. I shake my head, saying, no, just here for a drink. Her eyes are auburn, 
    I notice, her natural color. Wonder what that means?</b></font></p>

    that time of the year, again? Oh, and your birthday's on next week! God, everyone's

    I say, mentioning her name. She removes her hands from my eyes and sits down 
    beside me, where Richard was earlier. I see two extra pints of beer on the 
    table. One must be hers, I thought. And the other one must be mine.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#663399"><b><font size="5">&quot;W</font>hat 
    are you doing here?&quot; she asks. She's still so lively, like a cheerleader. 
    Not annoying liveliness. Friendly liveliness. Warm and lovely, and a bit charming, 
    actually. <i>Waiting for Saffron</i>, I tell her.</b></font></p>
