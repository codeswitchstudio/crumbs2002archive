    now it was night, and I was waiting for Saffron. It was that time of the year 
    again. Annual drink-up. She called me up the day before, to remind me. Wasn't 
    there, but the answerphone was.</font></b></font></p>

    she starts. Her voice was still that way, youthful and girly. &quot;It's Saffron. 
    Checked the calendar lately? It's March, man. Nearly your birthday, and you-know- 
    what-else. Call me? New number: 6116669. Trippy number, don't you think? Anyway, 
    hear you later.&quot;</font> </b></font></p>

  there by 10, and took our regular table beside the door, by the big glass window 
  overlooking the street. At mornings, I go there and just stare outside, making 
  up stories in my head about the people I see. It's good practice for a writer, 
  a friend of mine told me when I told her about what I was doing. I made this 
  screenplay for Richard the other month, something good for 30 minutes. A bit 
  of a drama-romance, with the characters' lives intersecting here and there. 
  Pretty complex, is what I think. Anyway, what I used for characters were some 
  of the characters (and stories) that I got from staring outside the window. 
  Like what my friend said. Good practice. </font> </b>
