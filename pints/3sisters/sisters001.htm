  of the regulars start pouring in: you see Richard the Super 8 Film-Guy gesturing 
  wildly while talking about his latest piece. In the other corner you see Vincent 
  the French Teacher. A thin guy, with a nose so big you can land a passenger 
  plane on it. And then you see Robin. Now, she's a little firecracker of a girl. 
  Animated like anything, very lively. Her ponytail even gives her this athletic 
  look, which I guess most men feel attracted by. Her athleticism, I mean. The 
  two of us fooled around for a year, two, maybe three years ago, now. She made 
  little wounded noises just before she came, and when she did, it was like being 
  in bed with a flock of banshees, I tell you.</font></b></font></div>

    in the middle of it all, THREE SISTERS crowd is pretty much a mixed sort: 
    6 in the PM, necktie wearing yuppies abound, their mobiles ringing like crazy, 
    some of them running off outside, chasing after the elusive Net Coverage, 
    ranting on and off about things like currency averages and IT and the cables 
    that should be under ground instead of overhead, and whatever bullshit that 
    they do for a living; by 10, </font></b></font></p>
