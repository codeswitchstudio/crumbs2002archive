  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">THIS IS THE EARLIEST 
    POLAROID I HAVE OF JOHN PAUL. It's of the two of us looking up at an air vent 
    grill at our Home Economics room back in Holy Angels, with a framed wooden 
    carving of a dancing couple hanging by my side, stiff broom in John Paul's 
    hand. It was the first quarter of the school year, and as group project, we 
    were told to prepare food for the class. Groups of at least four members, 
    the teacher told us. Everyone grouped up in fives and sixes, leaving Neptalle, 
    Rizen, John Paul and I groupless. There was an awkward moment before Rizen 
    declared that the four of us form the last group. We grumbled and sighed and 
    shrugged our shoulders (we were introverts, you see) and wrote our names in 
    a quarter sheet of yellow paper, and declared ourselves the Last Group.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">We made small bite-size 
    pan de sal pizzas for the class. We forgot to buy meat, so we ended up doing 
    vegetarian pizza: tomato sauce, green pepper and cheese. It was considered 
    a failure by the teacher, but as far as the four of us were concerned, it 
    was a success worthy of thirty orgasms, as the teacher unwittingly cemented 
    our bonds of friendship and camaraderie that'd prove to last up until now.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">The frustrated teacher 
    made us clean up after the other groups, and while John Paul and I were taking 
    self-imposed breaks, we were discussing the possible exits we could take just 
    in case Giger's xenomorphs come crawling in from the windows overlooking Santolan. 
    "We could take the air vent," John Paul suggested. We both looked up at the 
    ceiling, at the lone air vent grill screwed to the plywood. The grill was 
    as wide as a sheet of short bond paper: 8" by 11". "Too short, man," I told 
    him. "We can try, though. But we all know what happened to the space marines 
    when they took to the air vents…" I followed up.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">He regarded my hanging 
    statement with the respect it deserved, his gears grinding. He held up an 
    invisible motion detector at chest level and said "Twenty meters… Fifteen 
    meters… Five meters!!!" with much emotion. I, in turn, held up my invisible 
    Vulcan cannon strapped to my invisible GP belt and started spreading invisible 
    armor-piercing bullets, hoping in vain to hit the approaching xenomorphs.
