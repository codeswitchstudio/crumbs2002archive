  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">JOHN PAUL'S POSING 
    IN FRONT OF SEVERAL mannequins in a store selling sequined gowns in Ali Mall's 
    second floor cinema strip. All the mannequins in the display had at least 
    one finger missing, instead only scotch-tape covered stubs can be seen where 
    the fingers were supposed to be. It was rather bizarre.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I noticed it right 
    away, actually. "Look, John: she's missing a finger!!" I was feeling a bit 
    under the weather, and we were walking towards the stairs to go down and out 
    of the mall. The first mannequin we saw was missing her right index finger. 
    She was wearing a violet dress, sequins stitched on to it, making it glimmer 
    like a ball of small mirrors. "Here's another one!!" he called out. The mannequin 
    he found was missing her left ring finger. "And another one!!" he called out 
    again, this time a thumb was absent.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"Too bloody weird," 
    I said thoughtfully. John Paul was quiet for a bit, and then said, in the 
    best cement-scraping voice he could come up with (and with his sort of voice, 
    it must've been quite a feat), said "We're dealing with a serial killer here…" 
    I wanted to hit him on the head for getting to say the bloody line before 
    I even had the chance to think about it. </font></b></font></p>
