  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">THAT SCARLET TRAPEZOID 
    IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POLAROID is John Paul's Valentine's Day scar. Our school 
    had one of those Valentine's Day Dance Ball, and our teachers forced everyone 
    to go, with or without a date (of course, they encouraged that we come with 
    dates). The four of us (that's me, Marc, Gil and Joel) were playing on stage 
    when John Paul got the scar. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">We were playing "Love 
    is All Around" when it happened: John Paul and Archimedes were running around 
    the campus in the dark (it was night) and all the lights (except for the gymnasium's 
    set) were out. John Paul was chasing Archimedes around in the dark for some 
    reason or the other (I assume it was because Archimedes was making fun of 
    John Paul) when Archimedes, weasely Cebuano that he is, jumped up towards 
    the school benches (that were piled up one over the other). John Paul, being 
    the stubborn ass that he is, jumped up after Archimedes. Maybe it was the 
    dark, maybe it was because he wasn't thinking, but John Paul somehow hit his 
    right knee on the corner of a bench. He was howling in pain. We didn't hear 
    it, though, as we were busy playing on stage.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">John Paul bunched up 
    his trousers' right leg to show me the wound: the blow managed to scoop out 
    about a quarter of an inch's worth of flesh and meat. "I think I can see the 
    bone!!" Gil kidded. It was scarlet and wet and it looked like a piece of pepperoni 
    stuck to his knee.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">John Paul has another 
    scar: a small oval-shaped blankness below his left ear, near where the brainstem 
    should be, a souvenir from his La Salle High School days. People kept teasing 
    him about it, calling him names. I called him Jonny Mnemonic. </font></b></p>
