    IN LINE AT DAILY'S. We passed by the grocery to buy Iced Gems, an effort to 
    relive some fond fond memories form our childhood of oh so long ago. I haven't 
    seen a pack of those Iced Gems since 1989, way back in Pasay. My mother used 
    to buy me those everytime we went to the local Chinaman's store. I stumbled 
    on to them again quite by accident: I was there to buy deodorant, and I somehow 
    found myself in the Aisle of Coffee Grains (one of the best metaphors I have 
    ever read regarding colored people: "… different blends of coffee…" It was 
    written by Alan Moore). Shoved into one of the shelves was a discarded bag 
    of Iced Gems. I was quite surprised that they were still using their old packet 
    design: brown, white, yellow and orange, with a butterfly and a caterpillar. 
    That was how I recognized it. My head suddenly rewound into the past, as I 
    started smelling the alcohol fluid that the Chinaman used to use for his oil 
    lamp.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I think we waited 
    in line for about twenty minutes. We picked the Express Lane ("TEN PIECES 
    OR LESS" it screamed at us in red letters), as we only had one item to purchase. 
    But, the most awful thing: the lady in front of us had two carts of items 
    of various categories: glassware, rubber footwear, breakfast drinks, breakfast 
    cereals, processed meat, magazines, tobacco sticks, bread, jam, silverware, 
    laundry powder, deodorants, sanitary napkins, feminine pads… it was amazing. 
    And the weirdest thing was, the cashier never said a word about how much items 
    the lady shoved into the Express Lane.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">John Paul and I 
    exchanged wise-arse comments throughout, about the Express Lane. We were trying 
    to be patient. When it was time for her to pay for her groceries (three bloody 
    grand and twenty pesos!!), she pulled out a wad of gift cheques. I threw my 
    hands up to the air like an Arab being cheated out of his stash of incense.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">It took the cashier 
    ten minutes to clear the cheques. "I thought this was the Express Lane…" I 
    said quietly, as sweet as I could. The cashier just gave me an annoyed smirk, 
    as if we both knew a secret, like we both knew that she was wearing a thong, 
    and it was pushing up and into her arsehole. I smirked back at her and paid 
    for the Iced Gems (for a dozen Iced Gems, only twenty-nine pesos!!). John 
    Paul and I ate it as we walked to Cubao.</font></b></font></p>
