  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">I'M NOT IN THIS 
    POLAROID, BUT THE REST OF MY CLASS IS. That's John Paul in the left foreground, 
    his frown painted with Joel's blue and yellow poster color. Beside him is 
    Archimedes, that midget from Cebu. They are holding up this white banner saying 
    "FIRST-YEAR NARRA" in big blue letters, and right below it, in smaller type 
    "Ms. Leslie dela Cruz ~ Muse" and right below it, in the same type "Mr. Adam 
    David ~ Escort", both lines in blue. Snaking behind them are our classmates, 
    all the girls and all the boys. Notice that they are wearing blue, yellow 
    and red tie-dyed shirts, all of which were hand-dyed by me, eight or so hours 
    before this Polaroid was taken. We can only see John Paul's face here (which 
    is frowning), as the rest of the class is looking up to the gymnasium ceiling, 
    where a blue balloon was headed.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">It was our Second 
    Annual Holy Angels Montessori High School Intramurals. The event started with 
    the Parade of Colors, and we were the first section that paraded their colors 
    around the campus that year. Being freshmen, we were told by our advisers 
    that our color was blue (which explains the shirts and the face paint and 
    the balloons). The girls of the class arranged our whole routine for the parade: 
    we would walk around with our banners and balloons, giddy as heck, chanting 
    the freshmen's cheers. John Paul and Archimedes (for some reason no one really 
    told us) were picked to lead the group with the banner bearing our section's 
    name, and the balloons with names of the other sections and levels printed 
    on them. When given the signal, they were to make the balloons pop with a 
    pin, supposed to symbolize the other sections' defeat from us. </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">They had around 
    eight balloons, two balloons for each level. We reached the gymnasium, and 
    John Paul and Archimedes were ready like virgins: pin in one hand, stringed 
    balloons in the other. Vanessa gave them the signal, and Archimedes started 
    popping his balloons. The balloons popped one by one, their death given one 
    pop-salute each. It was with the sixth balloon when John Paul sneezed and 
    accidentally made the balloon fly up and away from the pin's reach. The whole 
    class groaned, the rest of the campus jeered and cheered, and John Paul let 
    out a resounding pronouncement of his frustration, so loud it made our adviser 
    give him a nasty glare: "SHIT!!" he said.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">We lost the intramurals. 
    And for around three months after that day, the whole school was constantly 
    reminded of that accident by that same blue balloon that wouldn't go away, 
    as it found its way into one of the six corners of the gymnasium's ceiling. 
    It was stuck there until it ran out of hydrogen. The girls never forgave John 
    Paul for that mistake.</font></b></font> </p>
