  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">THIS ONE HAS JOHN 
    PAUL GIVING AIZA SEGUERRA'S STAGE THE FINGER. About three months before this 
    Polaroid was taken, Arnold Clavio look-alike/child star Aiza Seguerra thought 
    it'd be a brilliant idea for a comeback. The media was saturated with her 
    new album, her new single, her Arnold Clavio mug plastered all over the malls, 
    at record bars and at the ABS-CBN News Channel. Gil even had the opening riff 
    of her carrier single as the bloody ringing tone of his bloody mobile phone. 
    It was rather amazing and sickening at the same time.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Now she was about 
    to perform at the newly renovated, quite culture-shocking Ali Mall. All four 
    floors were fifteen-heads thick with Aiza Seguerra fans. "Who here wants to 
    see Aiza Seguerra?" the emcee screamed to the microphone. Around a quarter 
    of the audience (me included) raised their hands, some of them even letting 
    out a girly "Yay!!". "Come on, man: let's stay and see Aiza Seguerra. I had 
    a neighbor who had a crush on her…" I said, looking up past the audience's 
    heads, to the stage. Aiza wasn't there, yet. The stage had a Styrofoam backdrop, 
    freckled with flakes of glitters. How bloody Eighties, Indira would say.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"Yeah, right, a 
    friend of yours," I heard John Paul say. I sensed a dash of wise-arse in his 
    voice. We walked to the drinking station and drank some regurgitated mineral 
    water. "The more we 'progress' in this New Millennium, the more stupid people 
    are created…" John Paul said after he finished drinking. I saw him scanning 
    the crowd like they were AMA students to his Assumptionista. "Hey, that's 
    a great line!! Can I write that down?" I asked him.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">He looked at me 
    and said "The more we 'progress' in this New Millennium, the more stupid people 
    are created…", making sure he said the words slow enough for me to write them 
    down on my notepad. We never got to see Aiza Seguerra, as John Paul got distracted 
    by the anime store.</font></b></font></p>
