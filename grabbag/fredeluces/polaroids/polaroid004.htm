  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">THAT BROWN BLUR 
    OF HATE TAKING UP three-fourths of the Polaroid is Ramoncito Dagondon, or 
    "Mon" to his friends. This was taken around ten minutes after our lunch break 
    at school, inside our classroom. It was during those last few months where 
    Mon was rapidly going down the Spiral Staircase of Crystal Meth. He was getting 
    more and more touchy about his name (which I guess was used against him ever 
    since he was in the maternity ward), and in that particular afternoon (was 
    during our finals, if I remember correctly), our Filipino Language teacher 
    made a crack about him.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">"Who laughed?" 
    he asked the class in a fit of rage. No one answered, and that pissed him 
    off a bit more. He let us know his discontent with a ridiculous roar. So ridiculous 
    it turns out, as next thing that the class heard was John Paul's stifled laughter.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">Mon's head reeled, 
    searching for the source of the laughter. We were about to stand up to pray 
    when Mon suddenly darted towards John Paul, fists clenched so tightly that 
    his neck was gnarled with veins. I moved as fast as I could, placing myself 
    between John Paul and Mon. I moved towards Mon and tackled him with a bear-hug. 
    I made the mistake of lowering my head like a turtle, as this gave Mon an 
    unobstructed view of John Paul's military-cut head.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">Mon hit John Paul's 
    head with three knuckles. I stood between the two, ready to pummel Mon in 
    case he decides to hit John Paul again. Joel dragged Mon away from us, kicking 
    and screaming that he'll get back on me next time. Behind me, I could hear 
    John Paul sobbing quietly, almost noiselessly. And every three silent sniffles, 
    he said "shit", but only to himself.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">Later that month, 
    I got a threatening phonecall from Mon's older brother (I think he was 26 
    or something. I was 14), him screaming at me, saying that he'll beat me senseless. 
    He never got me (but that's an entirely different Polaroid). </font></b></font></p>
