  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">THIS IS US WALKING 
    DOWN KATIPUNAN, the sun baking us with her hot hot hot summer glare. Which 
    was rather strange, as it wasn't summer, yet, as this was in a November weekday 
    (probably a Wednesday). The guy in a school uniform crossing the street is 
    Rizen Salonga, a classmate of ours. John Paul got rid of him, twenty seconds 
    before this Polaroid was taken.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">They dismissed 
    us during our lunch break, as they had to fumigate the whole campus for disease-bearing 
    mosquitoes (this was during one of those outbreaks). As we were walking down 
    from our classroom, I felt like I was an astronaut about to leave this alien 
    world I just stepped on several minutes ago. Like I was leaving some desolate 
    blue-colored desert planet behind. It felt weird, walking down the stairs 
    with such thoughts in mind. We went out the gate, the three of us, and proceeded 
    to walk to Katipunan in silence.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">"Where're the two 
    of you headed?" Rizen asked me. I shrugged my shoulder towards John Paul (who 
    was walking alongside me, to my right). It was too hot for speech. "My place," 
    John Paul told Rizen with a mix of boredom and irritation in his voice. "Can 
    I come with you?" he asked after ten minutes. John Paul and I exchanged worried 
    looks.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">"We still have 
    a long way to go, Rizen. I don't think you can hack it," John Paul told him. 
    I was quiet, squinting my eyes as the pavement glowed white-hot. It was true, 
    actually, what John Paul said. His house was at least four kilometers away 
    from where we were. "And we won't be doing much: just drink lemonade." That 
    was also true, only he left out the bit where we were going to eat cake (as 
    it was John Paul's sister's birthday) and fiddle about with his dad's workshop 
    (as we were building a custom-job marine vehicle for our Joes).</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">I stole a side-way 
    glance at Rizen, searching his face for rolling tears. We were acting like 
    snobs, I know, but we couldn't help it. Even Neptalle acted like a snob with 
    Rizen. When we reached Labor Hospital, Rizen darted to the left (away from 
    us, rightly so) and crossed Katipunan. Not even a goodbye from him. "Yes!!" 
    I heard John Paul cheer in a whisper.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">"Hehehe. Poor kid, 
    no?" I said during a Sprite-drinking break. John Paul laughed at that. "I 
    guess he finally got it," he said thoughtfully. I guess he did.</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><font size="2">The week after 
    that, the school was declared free of disease-bearing mosquitoes. That week 
    was also the start of Rizen's infamous streaks of absences, which went on 
    for months at a time. Funny thing about that was, he still made Student Number 
    Six in the Top Ten Best Students of Narra. John Paul and I were reportedly 
    Students Number Twelve and Eleven, respectively.</font></b></font><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">
