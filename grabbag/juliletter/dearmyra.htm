<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Myra, </font> 
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  SCOOBY-DOO is spinning rapidly out of Saturn's orbit. We're down to 15% power, 
  and according to the ship's AI, it's decreasing at a steady pace. I'm in Mess 
  Hall, and with Life Systems throughout the station turned off, it is cold and 
  dark where I am right now. I am running on my suit's back-up power, and it's 
  down to 40% as of this moment. I'm using the Dicta-Scribe, so I have to be quick 
  here, so I can send you this letter. Mi Ultimo Adios.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I get lonely here 
  in Jovian Lagrange Point 7. I imagine this is how those seamen of old used to 
  feel like, surrounded by water everywhere, floating idly by in their steel ships. 
  That's chickenshit, actually, if you compare it to cosmonaut isolation up here 
  in space. But it must've been hell during their time. I know it is, for me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have a photograph 
  of the two of us in my left breast pocket. It's the one you took back in the 
  library, about a week or so before I left. The one with you smiling in it. You 
  have such an easy smile, you know that? Funny thing is, this photo is the only 
  one I found with you smiling in it. You actually look a bit like an angel here, 
  with natural light coming through the window behind your head, a golden ring-halo. 
  Reminds me of a song: &quot;'di magawang / alisin ang aking mata / sa anghel 
  na nakikita / iniibig nga ba kita... ?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You always were 
  the one with the camera, snapping away at people and things like mad. I can 
  actually count in one hand the number of times you turned the camera to yourself. 
  And this is one of them. Like what I said earlier, I get lonely up here in space. 
  My stay was supposed to be 3 months long. Pretty quick, when you think about 
  it. But I just had to see you, even if in 2D only. I hope you don't mind.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With Artificial-Gee 
  turned off, I can actually feel SCOOBY-DOO spinning in space. All the escape 
  pods are jettisoning towards the nearest ISS, which is in Martian orbit. With 
  the power at 6%, there's no way to stop the station from spinning off towards 
  Andromeda.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And there's only 
  one means of escape.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Years and years 
  ago, NASA came up with a solution for times like this: a blue and yellow capsule 
  filled with cyanide. The Space Program still issues out such capsules to their 
  cosmonauts, just in case something like this happens.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I keep mine in my 
  right breast pocket.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I miss seeing the 
  sun rise, for some reason. Only saw that happen three, maybe four times in my 
  lifetime, yet I miss seeing it. Terribly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I remember first 
  seeing it as a kid. We used to live pretty near the beach, and every morning, 
  my dad would jog up and down the stretch of sand. Once, I asked him if I could 
  jog with him. Dad agreed, so the next morning, I woke up pretty early, must've 
  been four in the AM. Too early, it turned out, as I was out after ten minutes 
  of being half-awake. I woke up at about fifteen minutes before six, and I looked 
  out my window, and saw the sun rising. Orange and yellow and red and green. 
  It was amazing. I loop that memory in my head every other day, so as not to 
  forget it.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I miss seeing the 
  sun rise. It must be the darkness of space.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My suit's back-up 
  power is down to 18% right now. It takes 15% back-up to send a message to a 
  terrestrial mailbox.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I am looking at 
  our picture right now. I am making love to your sweet memory, right now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm sorry I won't 
  be home for Christmas this year. I hope you understand.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pressing send after 
  this. Time to blow this taco stand.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I love you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  - Juli Nadla</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS<br>
  Again, I love you, and in spite of recent events that transpired without our 
  consent, I still think Life is magical.</font></p>
