  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF6666">This 
    one has <a href="sachiko.htm" target="_self">Sachiko</a> in it, in one of 
    her sleeve-less shirts. It's a Monday afternoon, sunny outside and all. The 
    type where I used to go out to play on when I was but a wee lad. Sachiko's 
    hair is still short, the sides tucked unto the flaps of her ears.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF6666">Sachiko 
    is staring at the PeeCee monitor, right hand on her chin. The PeeCee has a 
    name, and it's Pepe. It was named after the Looney Tunes skunk, the one who 
    used to chase that cat with the white paint strip on her back. The speakers 
    are playing Ben Folds's 'Alice Childress'. a nice song, that was.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF6666">The 
    wall behind Pepe is made up of posters and drawings and documents. A wall 
    of color and words, held up by strips of adhesive tape. There's a twelve-page 
    comic strip on the right hand-side, several poems written on colored paper 
    on the left. Water-colored art here and there, care of Leon and Lily. Pages 
    and posters from various magazines are there, too, for variation and whatnot: 
    Beastie Boys, big sky mind, chinese stationery... they're about half a foot 
    away from the ceiling already.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF6666">The 
    desk is a bit cluttered. Not too messy, though. But not orderly, either. I 
    wonder what her room at home looks like?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF6666">It's 
    her colorful little corner at the office. Rosanna approves of it, as I heard 
    her say that. I don't know if Virginia would, if she sees it. - Juli</font></p>
