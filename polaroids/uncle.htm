  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">The 
    place would smell faintly of shit when he was around. Liquid shit. That was 
    about two or three months before he was confined to Philippine General. Two 
    or three months before <a href="boots.htm" target="_self">he died</a>. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">When 
    he was younger, he'd drink gin and whiskey and <a href="matthau.htm" target="_self">beer</a> 
    with his cousin Lawrence in my grandmother's house. I'd be trying to sleep 
    in the living room couch, while Jim Morrison and grass and the sound of beer-filled 
    glasses hitting one another trail their way to my mind, from outside. When 
    drunk (but not drunk enough), he'd wake me up and ask me to accompany him 
    to the neighborhood store to buy more beer. We'd walk around Kalantiaw at 
    midnight, chasing cats and kicking dogs as we went from one closed store to 
    the next. After drinking, he'd shout and rant in his sleep, raving like a 
    lunatic: "You wanna see my cock... ? C'mere, baby, I'll... I'll show you my... 
    cock... cockity-cock-cock..." </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    used to tease me about how my right hand would twitch and jerk when I listened 
    to my records, mock-strumming at an air <a href="guitar.htm" target="_self">guitar</a>. 
    "Why do you do that?" he asked me one time, as I came out of the bathroom. 
    I brought the player inside the bathroom with me, listening to Pearl Jam's 
    VITALOGY (my hand riffing along with 'Corduroy' that moment). I looked down 
    on my right hand and caught it jerking here and there, in synch with Stone 
    Gossard in the speakers. I smiled awkwardly, a bit ashamed (maybe even blushing 
    a bit). I just shrugged my shoulders and walked (actually, sulked in shame) 
    towards my makeshift-room in the sala. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">The 
    week after that, he had his belly against an operating table, getting his 
    intestines cut off of him, (through his ass, where they made a wide slice 
    across his butt-crack, which they stitched together right after). He was diagnosed 
    with cancer of the colon ("cans-arse" is what I call it), in its advanced 
    stage already. I remember him telling me his intestines were riddled with 
    yellow tumors, already. Beyond hope. They had to take out his intestines, 
    stitch a plastic tube to a plastic ring-lined hole about an inch or so from 
    his navel, leading from his stomach to a Ziplock-caliber plastic bag hanging 
    by his belly, where he was supposed to shit in. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    was always standing up when commuting, as he couldn't sit on his ass, as it 
    was sore as hell (even when the jeep was empty, he'd still be hanging out 
    its entrance-exit, by the handle bar). In my grandmother's house, he cleaned 
    his bag in the bathroom sink, with Pride laundry soap. Sometimes Tide. He 
    would do it in the afternoon, as there were less people in the house in the 
    afternoon. Less people using the bathroom. I stayed there in the afternoons 
    (it was summer vacation), playing Wolfenstein 3D in my aunt's 386. After washing, 
    he would go to the room and talk to me while I played. And we would talk, 
    and he would talk, and I would listen. And the whole time, he'd smell of shit. 
    Not a disgusting shit-smell, actually. It was a clean smell. Hospital smell. 
    But I knew it was shit. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">During 
    our afternoon talks, I realized several things: he was young (he was thirty-three 
    back then, the youngest in their family) and alive, so much still in front 
    of him, for the taking, but he felt tired and old and aching all in the wrong 
    parts (his heart, his mind, his belly and his arse). He was knocked-down, 
    burned-out, stank like medicated shit and limp like a glove. He had an estranged 
    wife that wouldn't make love with him, a young son that he saw two days a 
    week, and a plastic bag for an ass. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">"Look 
    at me," he said one Thursday afternoon (the sky outside was gray, yellow lamp-light 
    bathing his handsome features as he carefully sat up on bed). It was our last 
    heart-to-heart talk. "Look at me. I'm a monster, man. I shit in a bag, I can't 
    eat pizza, I can't even ride a jeepney properly. You know I have to stand 
    and hang by the handle bars, even if it's fucking empty?" </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    paused for a while, looking at himself in the mirror screwed to the wall opposite 
    the bed. After a minute or two, he said: "I can't live like this. You know 
    what keeps me going? You know the driving force that keeps me alive in mornings? 
    It's Joachim." Joachim is his son's name. "And I don't want him to see me 
    like this. But... but." </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    stopped, all of a sudden. He slowly crawled towards me (I was sitting on a 
    chair beside the bed, looking at him), held my hand, looked at my eyes. "Make 
    me a promise. A promise to a dying man." Sounds a bit weird, I know. It's 
    one of those lines of dialogue you only encounter under extremely weird occurrences. 
    </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">"A 
    promise to a dying man." he said. I nodded. He told me, almost in a whisper, 
    so no one would hear, not even God or the angels. For my ears only. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    told me, and I agreed. We sealed the promise with a handshake. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">Three 
    days later, he was confined to Philippine General. My mother and I visited 
    him on his second day there. A nurse was washing the wound on his ass-crack, 
    which was now infected like hell. I imagine it looked like pizza. His belly 
    was unnaturally swollen with gas. The tube that led from his stomach to the 
    belly-hole was inflamed. He was constipated. He was in so much pain, all he 
    could do was whine and wheeze under his breath, the sounds a bit raspy already. 
    A first thing for me: I saw Pain in his eyes. His mouth was open, his jaws 
    slacked a bit. His skin was pale and clammy to the touch. Cold sweat. And 
    his eyes. In his eyes was Pain. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">He 
    died two days later. Joachim wasn't even able to see him, as children below 
    twelve weren't allowed in the ICU rooms. He was cremated three days later 
    in Guadalupe. I refused to go to the funeral. Those who attended drank gin 
    and whiskey and beer, and played Jim Morrison in the closed-circuit audio 
    system. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">I 
    spent the day in my room, listening to 'the Unknown Soldier'. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">In 
    one of my bookshelves, there is a picture of me during the opening of our 
    high school graduation, seated between Mark Louie DeGuzman and Andrew Cementina. 
    We did the ceremonies in Abelardo Hall at UP (was a running joke the whole 
    day: "Where did you graduate?" "Me? I graduated in UP!!"). My hair still short 
    from CAT, but slowly creeping down towards my jawline were my sideburns, like 
    soft downy female pubes. </font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993399" size="4">In 
    the picture (actually, even in the flesh), on several angles, I look a lot 
    like my uncle. <br>
