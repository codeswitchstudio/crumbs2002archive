    <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Summer of 1997, 
    we were part of this series of mini-concerts around the metro. Various places, 
    different sorts of people for an audience: from Park Square in Ayala (at the 
    bus station), to Araneta Coliseum's yellow gate (in front of National Bookstore 
    Superbranch) in Cubao. We were fifteen years old, then, all four of us, and 
    the band was about a year and a half old.</font></font> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#FF0066" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    picture was taken at one of the two instances that we played in Cubao. We 
    were incoming Juniors in some Montessori school, if I remember correctly. 
    I'm wearing the same fading blue shirt I was wearing in the other picture 
    I told you about, with a black 'Commander Riker' shirt underneath. Anyway, 
    this time, my hair was a hell of a lot shorter, one of those military crops. 
    A bit modified, of course. Short on the back and the sides (five fingers by 
    seven fingers), but a bit long in the front. A bit like Tintin, I guess. I'm 
    not using my black guitar here, as Marc forgot to bring his Strat. I borrowed 
    a red Telecaster from the sponsor. Had no problem using it, and I actually 
    grew attached to it, as I borrowed it again in two separate occasions after 
    that, when we played at Ayala. It had this wonderful crystalline sound, even 
    when it was distorted. I loved that guitar.</font></p>
