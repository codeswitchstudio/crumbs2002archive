  <p align=left><font color="#FFCC00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Another 
    picture from the 80s. RJFM used to have their radio station in the Old Manila 
    district, along the University Belt. The booth was way up in the air, actually, 
    shaped like a flying saucer. A bit like the Space Needle. You could only get 
    up the booth through a spiral staircase winding from the rooftop of the building, 
    into the flying saucer booth.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">This 
    picture was taken inside the flying saucer booth. My dad is wearing his red 
    corduroy trousers (that I still have in the closet), green military coat (unbuttoned), 
    with that faded-green shirt that says PINOY ROCK in thin black letters (last 
    time I saw that shirt, I think I was nine), and a black beret. The photo is 
    a bit cropped on the sides, so we can't see his DMs.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">My 
    mum is wearing her pink Debbie Harry-esque coat (the sort that balloons on 
    the arms), black knee-length tights (I think. Can't tell from here), and her 
    black high-cut cowboy boots. Her hair is short here, boyish and blonde, almost 
    as short as my dad's. On her left hand is a fag, blurred as she was playing 
    with it. You can see her fingernails are painted sky-blue.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFCC00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Last 
    time I was near the flying saucer booth, I was with my brother, late last 
    year. He pointed it out to me inside the jeep. It now had mobile aerials growing 
    around it, like fungi on a twig. - Adam</font></p>
