    slept with him twice. Really just slept, in the literal sense. The first time 
    we were roomies at this ramshackle inn in the highlands. He was there for 
    less than 24 hours and he bunked with me out of, well, homophobia for this 
    guy in our group that he was supposed to bunk with. We were laughing at some 
    lame joke, having had too much weed.</font></font> 
  <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#663399"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    second time was in his room. There was a party and I vaguely remember why 
    I ended up lying there on his left arm. There was a dry kiss on lips parched 
    from too much beer. Then no more.</font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#663399"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
    he slept soundly, I heard the horn blares of early-morning buses on the thoroughfare 
    just around the corner and pretended we were in some clich&eacute; city that 
    never sleeps. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#663399"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd 
    pretend it was Paris and outside his window was the Eiffel tower instead of 
    the local network transmitter with its ultraviolet glow, waiting to fill airwaves 
    with the signals of high-rating and money raking cheesy gossip fare and variety 
    show inanities. <br>
    <br>
    Soon the dawn would break and the metro train would rumble back to life, and 
    his folks would arrive. I tiptoed to the washroom downstairs, brushed my teeth, 
    went back to his room and slipped on my socks, and laced up my shoes. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#663399"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    pinched his nose and ruffled his hair and he woke up and said he'd walk me 
    to the bus stop.</font></font></p>
