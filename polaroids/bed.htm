  <p align=left><font color="#00FF66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
    one was a picture of me, a bit of a candid shot, sitting up on my bed. Nice 
    effect in the picture was that it looked like a still from a movie. It was 
    grainy and fuzzy in all the right places. The photo got me to thinking: who'd 
    take a picture of me in bed? Obviously, the picture had to be at least five 
    years old, as I looked pretty young in the photo.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#00FF66" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    also looked like it was early morning when the picture was taken, which means 
    that I slept with <a href="her.htm" target="_self">the girl who took the picture</a> 
    (thinking it was a girl who took the photograph, as I've never ever slept 
    with a man before in me entire life. As near as I can remember, at least).
