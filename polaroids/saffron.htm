    this one was taken about a week ago. we were at this art center, hanging out 
    with some friends. they were having this rather extensive workshop. so extensive, 
    most of them had to bring their stuff and spend the night there in<br>
    the center.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">saffron 
    and i were behind the makeshift bookshelves, where the bed spreads were. only 
    a small part of the room, the darkest corner, even, as the fluorescent lights 
    were at the center of the place, and the bookshelves cast these huge shadows 
    on our corner.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">that's 
    me on the left (obviously), all in black. saffron on the right, in one of 
    her sleeveless shirts, the both of us seated on this bean-bag seat full of 
    tiny foam balls (which reminded me of my chemistry projects from way way way 
    back). our feet are stretched out before us. completely relaxed. we are reading 
    this thick thick book called BOOK OF EROTIC ART, VOLS 1 &amp; 2.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">pretty 
    much what you'd expect from a book with that sort of title: images from the 
    Kama Sutra (which still haunts me, for some strange reason) to French line 
    drawings (one guy in particular had a great hand with drawing hair) to pop-art<br>
    collages. in some of them, you had to squint and turn the book to its side 
    to understand what the drawing was.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">it 
    even had prints from an old chinese sex-humor book. it had these great muscular 
    men with penises the size of treetrunks, their members supported by makeshift 
    tripods, made from bamboo. we were both laughing, but for some<br>
    strange reason, i felt a bit insecure.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">after 
    erotic art, we attacked the children's books section of the bookshelves.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6633CC">we 
    arrived at the center at about 5PM, and we left at about 12AM. the sky was 
    indigo-dark when we finally left. like india ink with stars for bubbles. -Siddharta</font></p>
