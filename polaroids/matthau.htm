    one from the <a href="tongs.htm" target="_self">bizarre Samedi-Dimanche</a> 
    turn-over. It's a picture of this big old Yank talking on the phone. He's 
    so tall, he has to bend to reach the receiver. He's outside this Korean deli, 
    in his blue jacket and trousers, and he looks a lot like Walter Matthau.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">This 
    one comes with a bizarre story.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">You 
    see, we went to this Korean deli to buy some beer as it was pretty expensive 
    when you buy them from the bloody pubs. Anyway, we went to the freezers and 
    pulled out a bottle of Red Horse. We've been drinking for about six hours, 
    now, so we thought one bottle of kick-ass beer would be enough for the two 
    of us (that's me and <a href="sachiko.htm">Sachik</a>o, as Trackshine is the 
    designated driver). Also managed to grab a pack of the much-hunted, much-desired 
    Choc*Nuts, and a couple of packs of fish crackers.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Anyway, 
    while we were at the counter to pay for our stuff, this big old Yank walks 
    to my side and puts his bottle of beer on top of the counter, beside our stuff. 
    At the corner of my eyes, I saw that he bought Red Horse, too. I guess he 
    noticed that, as he leaned towards me and with his low Nick Cave-ish voice 
    he said to my ear</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;If 
    you want to take a ride, take Red Horse beer!!&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">and 
    I looked up at his Walter Matthau mug and said</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;Yeah, 
    you got that right, man!!&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">and 
    he gives out a hearty belly laugh and we slap palms and he hugs me like I 
    was his long lost kid.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#333399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Trackshine, 
    Sachiko and I leave the deli laughing. We just had a close-encounter with 
    a drunken Walter Matthau doppelganger. -Sid</font></p>
