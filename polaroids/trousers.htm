  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFCC33">This 
    one was taken about six years ago, an early Saturday morning in March. Marc 
    and I are standing in front of their garage's main entrance. God, we were 
    so young back then. I had one of those geeky haircuts, parted in the middle, 
    while Marc wore his hair long. Marc's wearing his school uniform as it was 
    Recognition Day, and he was one of the honor students. I'm not wearing mine, 
    as we didn't have any classes anymore, and I wasn't one of the recipients.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFCC33">Instead 
    I'm wearing this pale blue collared shirt with buttons in front and short 
    sleeves. I sort of look like a Mormon, actually. I had two pairs of trousers 
    on, one inside the other. The one inside was my Physical Ed. jogging trousers. 
    The one outside was this dark-blue pair my aunt made me. Made of cotton, it 
    was. Nice fit and all. The reason I was wearing two pairs was that the dark-blue 
    pair's zipper wasn't working. It was stuck, so I was walking around with the 
    zipper open. So, to avoid ridicule from schoolmates, I wore an extra pair 
    inside. I wasn't even supposed to be there that day. I went because I was 
    asked by Marc's mother to come to the Recognition Day as a photographer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFCC33">After 
    the celebrations, I was shooting the bull with Vanessa when she noticed my 
    zipper. &quot;Look!&quot; she told me, her right hand over her mouth, her 
    left pointing at my crotch. &quot;Your zipper's open!&quot; I opened the zipper 
    and showed her that I had an extra pair of trousers inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFCC33">I still 
    have that dark-blue pair of trousers in my closet. - Juli</font></p>
