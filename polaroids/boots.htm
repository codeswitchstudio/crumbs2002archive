  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#993333">This 
    one has my <a href="uncle.htm" target="_self">Uncle Wowie</a> in it. This 
    is one of those really nice candid pictures. You know the sort I'm talking 
    about? This one has him trimming his hair with a pair of black scissors. He's 
    seated on one of our wrought-iron chairs, peering into a mirror. This was 
    taken at around April, I think, in my grandparent's garage.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#993333">My 
    Uncle Wowie used to go to the city library to borrow some books. He'd go out 
    of his way to pass by our place to show me his latest finds: old National 
    Geographic Anthologies, a huge book on whales, this wide book with paintings 
    in them. Every month he'd have three or four new ones. He used to wear these 
    really nice-looking leather cowboy boots, whose feet tapered to the front, 
    forming a sharp point. It was knee-high, and it made this tip-tap-topping 
    noise when he walked. It was so loud, you could hear it from thirty feet away.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#993333">Whenever 
    I heard his boots, I ran outside the house and waited for him in the yard, 
    eager to see and read his new books from the library.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#993333">This 
    photo was taken about a month or so before he died. We cremated his body with 
    his boots. There was this big pile of ashes inside the oven. I remember thinking 
    about how much of those ashes were from my uncle and how much were from his 
    boots. It didn't matter, I thought, as the boots were him, too. - Adam</font></p>
