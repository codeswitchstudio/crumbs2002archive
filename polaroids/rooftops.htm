    This was taken on a cliffside by the Tuding-Baguio perimeter. We were lying 
    on old and grimy tatami mats, in this spot which everyone in his family called 
    the pugad. The nest was what was left of a hut which was built without nails, 
    Benguet-style, right on the roof of this creaking wooden two-storey that stood 
    on a fault line and was condemned after the great earthquake of 1990.<br>
    <br>
    Below the pugad, the houses were tiny monopoly playing-pieces on fog-covered 
    hills and the vista at Mines View Park was only half as breathtaking. I remember 
    the chilly air and much giggling. I remember sunflowers nodding at our mess 
    of straw, incense-stick butts, squashed berries, and dried bougainvilles. 
    I remember the sun smiling on the scraggly pines, making them look a bit more 
    lush and golden-green. <br>
    <br>
    But we don't see any of that in this shot: only him and me holding the camera 
    at arm's length as we lay there wearing silly grins.<br>
    <br>
    Today I wonder what the place looks like, since his dad turned the house into 
    an artist's inn. I'm sure they've kept the pugad. I've met the nice girl he 
    probably brings there on weekends. She looks like the type who enjoys climbing 
    rooftops too.<br>
