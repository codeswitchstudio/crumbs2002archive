  <p align=center><font size="5" color="#99FF33" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shower</b></font>
  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">A 
    mismatched pair of Nilo's sister's underwear: black bra, a bit lacy. Glossy 
    surface, like most bras are, with foam supports for the breasts. Its straps 
    are like black ribbons (like something you should tie violet gift-wrapping 
    paper with). It's actually the sort that opens in the front. A pair of cotton 
    panties. I think it's cotton, as it has that look to it: a bit faded from 
    regular laundering, a bit loose, yet still taut and firm at the same time. 
    The color's mainly violet, with pink and yellow horizontal lines running across 
    it. They're bunched up at the sides, as she rolled them down her legs.</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">I 
    found them lying on the tiled floor of their bathroom, under the cold blue 
    light of the fluorescent bulb fixed to the ceiling (funny thing, I could actually 
    smell it five or so feet away).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">I 
    walked in on her while she was taking a bath. Their bathroom was the sort 
    that local hotels have: a corridor between two rooms, so whoever used the 
    two rooms could both use the bathroom. not at the same time, hopefully (but 
    if that's your sort of thing...). It was supposed to be efficient and economical 
    or somesuch.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">I 
    was using the other room (what they called the 'Boys' Room'), and I made it 
    a point to wake up really early so I could use the bathroom for about one 
    hour, without fear of anyone walking in on me. Turns out, Nilo's sister had 
    the same idea, and she was already in the stall when I went inside the bathroom 
    with only a towel wrapped around my waist. I could see her naked form from 
    where I stood (a frosty shower curtain keeping us apart): she had her face 
    up towards the showerhead, her hands running up and down her torso. I could 
    hear the water pelting down against her skin. In the early morning silence, 
    I could hear her skin whispering as she soaped her body.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">Underneath 
    the towel, I felt my morning erection struggling between my legs, making a 
    rather obscene tent on the tightly-drawn towel. Embarassed, I tip-toed my 
    way towards my door, and that's when I crossed paths with her underwear.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#99FF33">I 
    picked them up with my right big toe (her undies actually a bit damp to the 
    touch) and flipped them into the laundry basket beside my door, and then I 
    walked out of the room to go to my bed. I left the door open a bit, three 
    to five inches open. After ten minutes, I heard her draw the shower curtain, 
    and a soft feminine smell snaked its way into my room. The sort of smell that 
    you smell when it's four o'clock in the morning and a girl walks out of the 
    shower.</font></p>
